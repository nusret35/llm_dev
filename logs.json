    "summarize managerial implications": " This section of the article discusses the managerial implications of the study's findings on revenue models for digital services. The authors argue that companies face challenges in selecting appropriate revenue models that align with their digital servitization goals, and that there are three key managerial implications to consider. Firstly, it is important for managers to understand the nature and characteristics of different revenue models (subscription, usage-based, and performance-based) and choose the one that best aligns with their business model. Secondly, managers need to develop a progressive understanding of the factors that influence their choice of revenue model, including customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Finally, managers should increase multi-actor participation in digital servitization processes and explore different mechanisms to test with customers and ecosystem actors. The authors provide a framework to guide managers through this process and encourage manufacturing firms to build on their legacy and experience to help other actors in the ecosystem transition towards pure digital servitization.",
    "summarize theoretical implications": " The article discusses the choice of revenue models for digital services in manufacturing companies undergoing digital transformation.

A four-step framework is proposed to help choose revenue models for digital services. The research contributes to the literature on digital servitization, pricing, and revenue models by providing insights into the ecosystem dimension of digital servitization, going beyond the internal view of companies offering digital services. The study highlights that the subscription model is the simplest and less risky option, while usage-based and performance models represent moderate and high risk, respectively. The choice of revenue model depends on the company's ability to interact with customers and ecosystem partners, and the willingness to share data and co-develop digital services.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This framework provides a four-step process for manufacturing companies to choose the right revenue model for their digital services. The first step is to assess the customer's digital readiness, including their awareness, value co-creation, and contractual arrangements. Based on this assessment, companies can choose between subscription models for basic digital services or usage-based and performance-based models for more advanced services.\n\nThe second step is to evaluate the digital service sophistication required, considering factors like data integration and analytics capabilities. Basic digital services require limited integration, while advanced services need more sophisticated data integration and analytics. Usage-based models are suitable for intermediate levels of digital service sophistication, while performance-based models are preferred for highly sophisticated services.\n\nThe third step involves evaluating digital ecosystem partnerships, considering data exchange and collaboration between actors. Subscription and usage-based models work well when there is no need for ecosystem participation, while performance-based models are better suited when multiple actors collaborate.\n\nFinally, the fourth step is to select a revenue model based on the previous assessments, taking into account the customer's digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Companies must make an informed decision about which revenue model best meets their needs and expectations for digital services.",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships in delivering digital services. Ecosystem actors, such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies, must work together to provide digital services. Data sharing and security, as well as co-development with ecosystem partners, are critical factors that enable the focal company to deliver digital services effectively.

The first step involves analyzing the customer's digital awareness, value co-creation, and contractual arrangements. Based on this analysis, companies can choose between subscription, usage-based, or performance-based models. The second step evaluates the digital service's sophistication, including data integration and analytics capabilities. Usage-based and performance-based models are more desirable for more sophisticated digital services. The third step assesses the need for data exchange and security between ecosystem actors. Performance-based models are appropriate when there is significant collaboration among actors. Finally, the fourth step involves selecting a revenue model that meets the needs concerning customers' digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships.",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships in delivering digital services. Ecosystem actors such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies need to collaborate and share data to provide seamless digital services. Data sharing and security are critical factors that enable focal companies to deliver digital services. Liberal data sharing allows collaboration among ecosystem actors, enabling them to gather precise data from diverse sources. However, data sharing is not always easy due to concerns about data safety and vulnerabilities. Digital ecosystem partnerships require adequate infrastructure systems that protect sensitive data from cyber-attacks. Co-development of digital services with ecosystem partners is also essential to leverage resources and skills. Close cooperation between actors is necessary to develop advanced digital services, and companies must adapt their internal IT skills to keep up with emerging technologies.",
