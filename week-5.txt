  the Internet’s design informs the
problems we deal with today
(and how we deal with them)

  •The Internet was designed to be flexible and robust to
failure. The commercialization of the Internet has
hindered its flexibility. When we design protocols for the
Internet, or design applications that use the Internet, we
have to work within the constraints of these early design
decisions.
•Recurring themes: layering, hierarchy, scalability,
performance and efficiency, diversity of applications,
economics, the end -to-end argument
