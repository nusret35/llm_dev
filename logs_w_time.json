    "summarize introduction": " The article discusses the challenges faced by manufacturing companies in choosing appropriate revenue models for their digital services, as they transition from traditional product-based business models to digital servitization. The authors argue that the choice of revenue model is critical in capturing value from digital services and overcoming the \"digitalization paradox,\" where companies struggle to generate profits from their digital offerings. They identify three key factors that influence the choice of revenue models: customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. The study contributes to the existing literature on pricing and revenue models by moving beyond traditional approaches focused solely on the company's internal view and instead adopting an ecosystem perspective. The authors also provide a rich perspective on revenue models and the value-capture dimension of business models for digital services, and offer insights into how manufacturing companies can overcome the digitalization paradox.",
    "summarize managerial implications": " This section of the article discusses the managerial implications of the study's findings on revenue models for digital services. The authors argue that companies face challenges in selecting appropriate revenue models that align with their digital servitization goals, and that there are three key managerial implications to consider. Firstly, companies need to understand the nature and characteristics of various revenue models (subscription, usage-based, and performance-based) and choose the ones that best fit their business models. Secondly, managers must develop a deep understanding of the factors that influence their choice of revenue model, including customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Finally, manufacturing companies should increase multi-actor participation in digital servitization processes and adopt a flexible approach to negotiating with multiple stakeholders and adapting to changes over time.",
    "summarize theoretical implications": " The article discusses the choice of revenue models for digital services in manufacturing companies undergoing digital transformation. It identifies three influencing factors - customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships - and proposes a four-step framework to inform the choice of revenue models. The study contributes to the emerging literature on digital servitization by offering an in-depth perspective on the value-capturing dimension of digital services and extends previous research on revenue models by showing that each model contains unique characteristics that have been overlooked in previous studies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of involving ecosystem actors in the digital servitization process.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This framework provides a sequential four-step approach for manufacturing companies to choose suitable revenue models for their digital services. The first step involves evaluating the customer's digital readiness, including their awareness, co-creation potential, and contractual arrangements. Based on this analysis, companies can select subscription models for less digitally advanced customers or usage-based and performance-based models for more advanced ones.\n\nThe second step entails assessing the level of digital service sophistication required, considering factors like data integration and analytics capabilities. Subscription models suit basic digital services, while usage-based and performance-based models are preferred for advanced services with higher customization levels.\n\nIn the third step, the need for ecosystem partnerships is evaluated, considering data exchange and security between actors. Basic digital services do not require ecosystem participation and can employ subscription or usage-based models. In contrast, performance-based models are more appropriate when multiple actors collaborate in delivering digital services.\n\nFinally, the fourth step involves selecting a revenue model that aligns with the customer's digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and ecosystem partnerships. There is no single optimal choice of revenue model; instead, companies must make an informed decision based on their specific circumstances.",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships in delivering digital services. Ecosystem actors such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies must collaborate to provide a seamless digital experience. Data sharing and security are critical factors that enable the focal company to deliver digital services. Liberal data sharing allows collaboration among ecosystem actors, enabling them to gather precise data from diverse sources. However, data sharing is not always straightforward, and ecosystem partners must be willing to build adequate infrastructure systems to protect sensitive data. Digital service co-development with ecosystem partners is another essential aspect of digital ecosystem partnerships. It involves working together to leverage resources and skills to provide digital services. Closer cooperation between ecosystem partners can lead to more advanced digital services, as seen in the example of Beta's cloud-based predictive maintenance solution.",

    "summarize introduction": " The article discusses the challenges faced by manufacturing companies in selecting appropriate revenue models for their digital services, highlighting the \"digitalization paradox\" where companies struggle to capture profits from digital offerings despite investing in R&D and new technologies. The authors argue that the choice of revenue model is critical to optimal positioning of digital services and note a lack of research in this area, particularly for manufacturing companies undergoing digital transformation. They conducted a case study of two global railway industry manufacturers transitioning to digital servitization, finding three key factors influencing revenue model choice: customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. The study contributes to the literature by providing insights into overcoming the digitalization paradox, extending knowledge of digital servitization, and offering an ecosystem perspective on pricing and revenue models.",
    "summarize managerial implications": " The article discusses the challenges companies face in choosing appropriate revenue models for their digital services, highlighting the importance of understanding the nature and characteristics of different revenue models and factors that influence their choice. The authors suggest a framework for managers to make informed decisions on revenue models, considering customer digital readiness, service sophistication, and partnerships in the digital ecosystem. They also emphasize the need for continuous adaptation and multi-actor participation in the digital servitization process. The study aims to aid manufacturing companies in selecting revenue models that align with their digital servitization goals, enabling them to gradually accelerate their transition over the long run.",
    "summarize theoretical implications": " This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of factors influencing manufacturing companies' choices of revenue models for digital services. The researchers argued that as manufacturing companies transition from selling stand-alone products to advanced product\u2013service\u2013software offerings, understanding how to make positive profit gains is crucial. They extended the digital servitization literature by offering an in-depth perspective on the value-capturing dimension of digital services. They found that there are various options for revenue models, and each model contains characteristics such as payment type, risk level, and contractual orientation. These models include subscription, usage-based, and performance models. The study's three contributions include extending the digital servitization literature, identifying and describing influencing factors that mitigate the \"digitalization paradox\" for manufacturing companies, and providing insights beyond the internal view of companies offering digital services. The three factors they identified were customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Overall, this article provides valuable insight into revenue models for digital services.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This framework proposes four steps to help manufacturing companies choose suitable revenue models for their digital services. The first step involves evaluating the customer's digital readiness, including their awareness of digital services, ability to co-create value, and contractual arrangements. Depending on their level of digital readiness, companies can choose between subscription-based, usage-based, or performance-based revenue models. \n\nThe second step involves assessing the level of digital service sophistication required by the customer. Basic, intermediate, and advanced digital services may require different revenue models. For instance, smart lock systems would use a usage-based revenue model, while predictive maintenance solutions might employ a performance-based revenue model incorporating expertise into data integration and analytics.  \n\nThirdly, assessing digital ecosystem partnerships is essential, as the delivery of digital services may involve data sharing between the company and its customers, or even among multiple actors within an ecosystem. Subscription and usage-based models work well when only two parties are involved. Still, performance-based models become more fitting when multiple actors collaborate in delivering the service, requiring higher degrees of risk and reward sharing. \n\nFinally, after considering these factors, companies should select the most appropriate revenue model that balances the overall demands of consumers' digital preparedness, digital service complexity, and digital partnership agreements. These diagnoses provide insights into selecting the best revenue model for each particular situation since all three assessments work together to inform this decision. Companies must analyze their clients' digital maturity, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem involvement simultaneously to ensure they capture the essential components needed to make a practical choice of revenue model that fits their customers' specific needs and those of their ecosystem.",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships for the delivery of digital services. Ecosystem actors, such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies, need to work together to provide digital services. Data sharing and security are critical factors that enable the focal company to partner with ecosystem actors. Liberal data sharing allows collaboration among ecosystem actors, enabling them to gather precise data from diverse sources. Co-development with ecosystem partners is also essential for delivering digital services. The focal company must obtain data-sharing rights from railway operators to access information on trains and maintenance schedules. Ecosystem partners must be willing to build adequate infrastructure systems that protect sensitive data from vulnerabilities. Cyber-attacks can compromise data, so data sharing requires an infrastructure that ensures data safety through security standards and interoperable protocols. Digital ecosystem partnerships are underpinned by co-development with ecosystem partners, which consists of exchanges and collaborations with different actors to leverage resources and skills. External people are used for developing IT skills that adapt continuously to available technologies. Close cooperation between ecosystem partners creates advanced digital services.",

The authors suggest a 2x3 matrix with six quadrants, each representing a different combination of the three RM mechanisms: communication openness (COM), technical involvement (INV), and customer value anticipation (CVA).\n\nThe six quadrants are named based on the empirical results and are as follows:\n\n1. Value anticipation based on distant communication - increasing PR during an economic crisis by reducing INV while enhancing CVA.\n2. Cost-oriented joint collaboration - reducing CTS during an economic crisis by establishing a strong INV and focusing on cost-reducing opportunities.\n3. Dyadic top management consensus - enhancing EC during an economic crisis by exploiting TMC and diminishing INV.\n4. Generative hard work - increasing PR during times of economic recovery by leveraging INV, TMC, and CVA.\n5. Controlled technical deescalating - reducing CTS during times of recovery by carefully deescalating INV.\n6. Integrated optimal balance - enhancing EC during times of recovery by integrating efforts on INV, CVA, and TMC.\n\nThe authors recommend that suppliers focus on the variable(s) they can most efficiently leverage to achieve their goals, while also considering the potential impact of each RM mechanism on other goals. Overall, the study provides insights into the managerial implications of the proposed RM mechanisms and offers practical strategies for firms to achieve their goals during times of economic crisis and recovery.",

The authors investigate the role of relational mechanisms, such as communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation, in mitigating the negative impact of economic fluctuations on B2B relationships. They also explore how these mechanisms can help transform the inherent tension created in a business contraction into effective learning for adapting the relationship during economic crises.\n\nThe study contributes to the existing literature on B2B relationships and economic swings by providing empirical evidence on the key role of customer value anticipation in navigating economic downturns. It also extends the dialectical view on buyer-seller relationships by showing that high levels of technical involvement are not always required to manage tension between suppliers and buyers.\n\nAdditionally, the study highlights the importance of investing in relationships during economic downturns to consider forward-looking measures such as customer lifetime value. The findings suggest that organizations can advantage other structural knowledge generation sources since challenges to prosperity can be idiosyncratic to the dyad and its business network, especially in emerging markets.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights for B2B suppliers on how to navigate economic downturns and maintain their relationships with customers.

The study identified three key RM mechanisms that differ in their effectiveness during times of economic crisis versus recovery: communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation.\n4. The six quadrants of the proposed RM matrix are: Value anticipation based on distant communication, Cost-oriented joint collaboration, Dyadic top management consensus, Generative hard work, Controlled technical deescalating, and Integrated optimal balance.\n5. Suppliers should focus on the variable(s) they can most efficiently leverage to achieve their goals while considering the potential impact of each RM mechanism on other goals.\n6. The study extends the dialectical view on buyer-seller relationships by showing that high levels of technical involvement are not always required to manage tension between suppliers and buyers.\n7. Organizations should invest in relationships during economic downturns to consider forward-looking measures such as customer lifetime value.\n8. The findings suggest that organizations can advantage other structural knowledge generation sources since challenges to prosperity can be idiosyncratic to the dyad and its business network, especially in emerging markets.\n9. This research provides valuable insights for B2B suppliers on how to navigate economic downturns and maintain their relationships with customers.\n10. The study underscores the significance of extending BC marketing literature outside the often-used U.S. environment and contributing to the vision for this century's marketing research to be all about emerging markets.",

The authors suggest a 2x3 matrix with six quadrants, each representing a different combination of the three RM mechanisms: Communication Openness (COM), Technical Involvement (INV), and Customer Value Anticipation (CVA). Each quadrant is named based on the empirical results and corresponds to a specific RM strategy.\n\nThe first quadrant, \"Value anticipation based on distant communication,\" focuses on increasing the selling price (PR) during an economic crisis. Suppliers should reduce their technical involvement with customers while fostering communication to learn about their needs and wants. This allows suppliers to establish a high level of communication without increasing technical collaboration.\n\nThe second quadrant, \"Cost-oriented joint collaboration,\" aims to reduce the cost-to-serve (CTS) during an economic crisis. Suppliers should establish a strong INV with customers, focusing on cost-reducing opportunities and generating savings for both actors.\n\nThe third quadrant, \"Dyadic top management consensus,\" focuses on enhancing the expectation of continuity (EC) during an economic crisis. Suppliers should exploit Top Management Consensus (TMC) with customers, nudging top managers to reach consensus on how to face the economic crisis together.\n\nThe fourth quadrant, \"Generative hard work,\" aims to increase the PR during times of economic recovery. Suppliers should leverage their ability to be technically involved with customers, have compatible top managers, and anticipate customer value altogether.\n\nThe fifth quadrant, \"Controlled technical deescalating,\" focuses on reducing the CTS during times of economic recovery. Suppliers should carefully deescalate INV, as neither CVA nor TMC has an influence on accomplishing this goal.\n\nFinally, the sixth quadrant, \"Integrated optimal balance,\" aims to enhance the EC during times of economic recovery.

    "summarize introduction": " Introduction: Relationship marketing (RM) has been well established in business-to-business (B2B) settings, especially during economic contraction. However, the influence of increasing competition, customer complexity, and market turbulence creates a latent hazard for sustainability. Nordin and Ravald assert that a long-term relationship can suffer from changes in customer needs or supplier strategy. Companies strive to manage and survive economic fluctuations, such as a drop in GDP growth and local currency depreciation. Extant literature on RM suggests that interorganizational learning is important for firms to access markets, develop marketing responses, and leverage process capabilities of partners. Williamson recognizes that bilateral relationships can minimize potential governance problems during the exchange. Organizations have an advantage over markets and hierarchy by leveraging human abilities to take initiative, cooperate, and learn. Prior research on transformational relationship events has generally focused on ad hoc strategies and practitioners' attitudes and behaviors, neglecting environmental turbulence impact. This article integrates a BC, an industrial setting, and an emerging economy, addressing the research gap and contributing to understanding buyer\u2013seller relationships during economic swings. It adopts RM and interorganizational learning theories to identify relationship tenets helping suppliers find ways to sust",

The paper adopts RM and interorganizational learning theories to identify relationship tenets that help suppliers find ways to sustain or increase performance from their B2B long-life customers during economic swings.\n\nKey Relationship Process Mechanisms:\n\nThe authors identify three key relationship process mechanisms that explain the divergence between managing B2B markets in times of economic crisis and recovery. These include communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation,",
    "summarize managerial implications": " This section discusses the managerial implications of the proposed Relationship Mechanisms (RM) for achieving firm goals during times of economic crisis and recovery. The authors suggest a 2x3 matrix with six quadrants, each representing a different combination of the three RM mechanisms: Communication Openness (COM), Technical Involvement (INV), and Customer Value Anticipation (CVA).\n\nThe six quadrants are named based on the empirical results and are as follows:\n\n1. Value anticipation based on distant communication - increasing PR during an economic crisis by reducing INV while enhancing CVA.\n2. Cost-oriented joint collaboration - reducing CTS during an economic crisis by establishing a strong INV and focusing on cost-reducing opportunities.\n3. Dyadic top management consensus - enhancing EC during an economic crisis by exploiting TMC and diminishing INV.\n4. Generative hard work - increasing PR during times of economic recovery by leveraging INV, TMC, and CVA.\n5. Controlled technical deescalating - reducing CTS during times of recovery by carefully deescalating INV.\n6.

Finally, the study extends BC marketing literature outside of the often-used US environment and provides insights into B2B relationships in an emerging economy.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for theory and practice. First, it shows that B2B relationships can serve as a quasi-integrated structure to cope with economic turbulence. Second, it highlights the importance of managing relationships during times of economic contraction and expansion. Third, it suggests that organizations can advantage other structural knowledge generation sources since challenges to prosperity can be idiosyncratic to the dyad",

It highlights how the choice of revenue model can impact a company's ability to capture value from its digital offerings, and how misaligned revenue models can hinder profit generation. The authors argue that there is limited research on revenue models for digital services in manufacturing companies undergoing digital transformation. They conducted a study with two global manufacturing companies in the railway industry to explore the factors that influence the choice of revenue models for digital services. The study found that customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships are key factors considered by manufacturing companies when choosing revenue models for digital services. The findings contribute to the literature on pricing and revenue models, and provide insights into overcoming the digitalization paradox.",

Finally, the study provided insights beyond the internal view of companies offering digital services, highlighting the importance of involving ecosystem actors in the digital servitization process.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This study proposes a framework for manufacturing companies to choose revenue models for digital services. The framework includes four steps: assessing customer's digital readiness, evaluating digital service sophistication, assessing digital ecosystem partnerships, and choosing a suitable revenue model. The first step involves analyzing the customer's digital awareness, value co-creation, and contractual arrangements. Based on this analysis, companies can choose between subscription, usage-based, or performance-based models. The second step entails evaluating the digital service's sophistication, such as basic, intermediate, or advanced, and determining the level of data integration and analytics required. Usage-based and performance-based models are preferred for more sophisticated digital services. The third step examines the need for data exchange and security between ecosystem actors and their collaboration in developing digital services. Performance-based models are suitable when several actors participate in the delivery of digital services. Finally, the fourth step involves selecting a revenue model that meets the needs concerning customers' digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Companies must make an informed decision on which revenue model is appropriate for their digital services after considering all three assessments.",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships in delivering digital services. Ecosystem actors such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies need to partner with the focal company to provide digital services. Data sharing and security, as well as co-development with ecosystem partners, are critical factors that enable the focal company to position components of digital services across various actors. Liberal data sharing allows collaboration among ecosystem actors, enabling them to gather precise data from diverse sources. However, data sharing can be challenging due to concerns about data usage and cyber attacks. Ecosystem partners must work together to build adequate infrastructure systems that protect sensitive data and ensure interoperability between different systems. Close cooperation between ecosystem partners is necessary to develop advanced digital services, as illustrated by Beta's creation of a cloud-based predictive maintenance solution in partnership with global players in the tech sector.",

This article aims to examine how RM process affects firm performance during economic contraction and expansion, focusing on long-term B2B customers in emerging economies. It integrates a BC, industrial setting, and emerging economy, addressing a gap in current literature.\n\nTheories: RM and interorganizational learning theories are adopted to identify relationship tenets that help suppliers sustain or improve their performance from B2B long-life customers during economic swings.\n\nKey Mechanisms: Three key mechanisms explaining the divergence between managing B2B markets in times of economic crisis and recovery are identified: communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation. These have direct and indirect effects on the supplier's performance.\n\nResearch Questions: Two research questions guide the study: How is RM process linked to firm performance during a BC? What are the different mechanisms related to increased firm performance during both times of crisis and recovery?\n\nContributions: The study contributes to the RM literature and BC literature by identifying the key relationship process mechanisms that explain the divergence between managing B2B markets in times of economic crisis and recovery.

During economic crises, companies should focus on \"value anticipation based on distant communication\" by reducing technical involvement with customers while fostering customer value anticipation through communication media such as email and telephone. This allows suppliers to establish high levels of communication without deepening technical collaboration.\n\nDuring economic recoveries, companies should prioritize \"generative hard work\" by leveraging their ability to be technically involved with customers, having compatible top managers, and anticipating customer value altogether. However, controlled technical deescalating may also be necessary to reduce costs. Finally, an integrated optimal balance among all relationship mechanisms is recommended to enhance expectations of continuity during times of recovery.",
    "summarize theoretical implications": " This study examines how business-to-business (B2B) suppliers can navigate economic downturns and maintain their relationships with customers. The authors argue that traditional marketing literature has focused on the negative aspects of economic swings, but they aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of how B2B relationships can thrive during economic contractions. They conducted a survey of B2B suppliers in Chile and found that certain relationship mechanisms, such as communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation, can help mitigate the financial impact of an economic downturn. These mechanisms allow the supplier to transform the inherent tension created by the economic fluctuations into effective learning for adapting the relationship during a BC. Additionally, the study shows that investments in relationships need to consider forward-looking measures such as customer lifetime value, and that the ability to learn from a customer through economic crises should be considered in customer valuation approaches. The findings contribute to the theoretical underpinnings of B2B relationships and extend the dialectical view on buyer\u2013seller relationships. Finally, the study highlights the importance of considering the unique challenges faced by organizations in emerging markets, where institutional voids make it difficult for marketers to obtain access to useful information.",

They identify and test a model that accounts for the variations in price, cost-to-serve, and expectations of continuity during a BC. The model is based on RM and inter-organizational learning theories.\n\nThe findings show that large size, market leader suppliers can effectively survive and thrive through a BC via distinct RM mechanisms. This suggests that companies can leverage their strong relationships with customers and suppliers to navigate difficult times and maintain their market position.\n\nOverall, this research provides valuable insights for businesses facing a BC in an emerging economy.

Reduce Social Media Use: Individuals should limit their social media usage to less than 30 minutes per day, as excessive use is linked to depression, anxiety, and poor well-being. Setting time limits, taking breaks from social media, and engaging in offline activities can help reduce usage. Supporting evidence: A study published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking found that limiting social media use to 30 minutes per day led to significant improvements in well-being over three weeks.\n2. Practice Self-Compassion: Social media users should practice self-compassion when scrolling through their feeds, recognizing that everyone presents a curated version of themselves online. Users should avoid comparing their lives to others', focus on their strengths, and cultivate gratitude for what they have. Supporting evidence: Research conducted at the University of California, Berkeley, found that practicing self-compassion can reduce feelings of envy and increase happiness.\n3.

    "summarize introduction": " Introduction: Relationship marketing (RM) is crucial in business-to-business settings, especially during economic downturns. This article investigates how RM processes affect companies' performance during economic contraction and recovery, focusing on long-term customers in emerging economies. It also explores communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation\u2014mechanisms that differentiate managing B2B markets during times of economic crisis and recovery.\n\nThe literature suggests that interorganizational learning helps firms access markets, develop marketing responses, and leverage process capabilities of partners. However, previous studies have not explained how firms should adapt their relationship mechanisms during a business cycle (BC). Emerging economies have a substantial share of interorganizational relationships in business organizations, and commodities dominate GDP, which is notorious for cyclical behavior. This study integrates BC, an industrial setting, and an emerging economy, addressing the gap in the current body of research.\n\nThis paper will address two questions: 1. How is the RM process linked to firm performance during a BC from the supplier's perspective? 2. What are the different mechanisms related to increased firm performance during both times of crisis (contraction) and recovery (expansion)? The study adopts RM and interorganizational learning theories to identify relationship ten",

The authors suggest a 2x3 matrix with six quadrants, each representing a different combination of the three RM mechanisms: communication openness (COM), technical involvement (INV), and customer value anticipation (CVA). Each quadrant is named based on the empirical results and includes strategies for effectively managing each quadrant.\n\nThe first quadrant, \"Value anticipation based on distant communication,\" focuses on increasing the selling price (PR) during an economic crisis by reducing the technical involvement (INV) with customers while still being able to enhance the expectation of continuity (EC). Suppliers can achieve this by establishing high levels of communication without simultaneously increasing technical collaboration.\n\nThe second quadrant, \"Cost-oriented joint collaboration,\" aims to reduce the cost-to-serve (CTS) during an economic crisis by establishing a strong INV with customers while keeping ideas associated with customer value for future times. This can be achieved by concentrating technical work on cost-reducing opportunities and generating savings for both actors.\n\nThe third quadrant, \"Dyadic top management consensus,\" focuses on enhancing EC during an economic crisis by exploiting top management consensus (TMC) with customers",

The authors argue that interorganizational relationships are crucial for navigating economic uncertainty and that relationship marketing (RM) mechanisms can help mitigate the financial impact of a recession. They identify three main RM mechanisms: communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation. These mechanisms can be configured to successfully navigate a recession, providing quantitative testing. The study also shows that managing B2B relationships during a recession differs from times of economic expansion and that investments in relationships need to consider forward-looking measures such as customer lifetime value. The findings contribute to the theoretical underpinnings of B2B relationships and provide insights into extending BC marketing literature outside the often-used US environment.

    "summarize introduction": " Introduction:\n\nThe article discusses the importance of relationship marketing (RM) in business-to-business (B2B) settings, particularly during times of economic turbulence. RM refers to the process of building and maintaining long-term relationships between suppliers and customers. Previous research has shown that RM can help companies adapt to changing customer needs and market conditions. However, there is a lack of research on how RM mechanisms should be adapted during economic contractions and expansions.\n\nEconomic fluctuations pose a latent hazard to established buyer-seller relationships. Companies strive to manage and survive economic fluctuations, which can emerge from a bank run and/or correction in exchange rate. Prior research focused on ad hoc strategies and attitudes and behaviors of practitioners, neglecting the potential impact of environmental turbulence. This paper aims to address this gap by studying the impact of RM process on determining the specific contribution of long-life customers in emerging economies during periods of contraction and expansion.\n\nLiterature Review:\n\nExtant literature suggests that interorganizational learning is an important way for firms to access markets, develop marketing responses, and leverage process capabilities of partners. Bilateral relationships can minimize potential governance problems during the exchange. Organizations can leverage",

The authors argue that while RM has been well established in the literature, there is a need to explore relationship dynamics in business contexts characterized by high turbulence, such as during economic contraction. They note that industrial suppliers, such as Grainger, have successfully navigated customer relationships during economic crises and adapted their behavior when the economy expanded again. The authors suggest that firms adjust their relationship mechanisms during a business cycle (BC) to manage relationship performance. They integrate a BC, an industrial setting, and an emerging economy in their study and investigate the impact of RM process on determining the specific contribution of long-life customers in emerging economies during periods of contraction and expansion. Finally, they identify key relationship process mechanisms explaining the divergence between managing B2B markets in times of economic crisis and recovery.",
    "summarize managerial implications": " The article discusses the implications of different resource management (RM) strategies on customer level outcomes in business-to-business (B2B) relationships during economic crises and recoveries. The authors propose a 2x3 matrix with six quadrants, each representing a different combination of RM strategies to achieve firm goals. The quadrants are named based on the empirical results and include: \"Value anticipation based on distant communication,\" \"Cost-oriented joint collaboration,\" \"Dyadic top management consensus,\" \"Generative hard work,\" \"Controlled technical deescalating,\" and \"Integrated optimal balance.\"\n\nThe authors suggest that during an economic crisis, suppliers should focus on reducing communication openness (COM) and increasing technical involvement (INV) to enhance customer value anticipation (CVA) and reduce cost-to-serve (CTS). They also recommend establishing a strong INV with customers while keeping ideas associated with customer value for future times. During times of economic recovery, suppliers should leverage their ability to be technically involved with customers, have compatible top managers, and anticipate customer value altogether.\n\nThe authors also emphasize the importance of carefully deescalating INV during times of recovery to reduce CTS without negatively affecting the likelihood of the supplier being able to increase prices and avoid breaking up the relationship in the future. Finally, they",
    "summarize theoretical implications": " This study examines how business-to-business (B2B) suppliers can navigate economic downturns and maintain their relationships with customers during times of economic uncertainty. The authors argue that interorganizational theories suggest that buyer-seller relationships can help navigate economic uncertainty, but prior research has not explored specific relational mechanisms or their role in mitigating financial impact. The study extends existing research by showing how a BC brings profitability opportunities for B2B suppliers through nurturing a system of mechanisms from long-term dyadic exchange. The main RM mechanisms identified include communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation. The study also contributes to the dark side of B2B relationships' theoretical underpinnings by showing that the inherent tension created in a BC can be managed by RM mechanisms. Finally, the study extends BC marketing literature outside of the often-used US environment and answers calls for more marketing research in non-advanced settings.\n\nIn summary, the study highlights the importance of buyer-seller relationships in navigating economic downturns and identifies specific mechanisms that can help B2B suppliers maintain their relationships with customers during times of economic uncertainty. The findings contribute to the development of interorganizational theory and provide insights into the management of business relationships in emerging markets.",

The framework includes four steps: assessing the customer's digital readiness, evaluating digital service sophistication, assessing digital ecosystem partnerships, and choosing the suitable revenue model. The first step involves analyzing the customer's digital awareness, value co-creation, and contractual arrangements. Based on this analysis, companies can choose between subscription-based, usage-based, or performance-based models. The second step entails evaluating the level of data integration and analytics required for the provision of digital services. Usage-based and performance-based models are preferred when customers opt for higher customization levels. The third step considers ecosystem actors' participation in data exchange and co-development of digital services.

It highlights the \"digitalization paradox\" where companies struggle to capture profits from their digital offerings despite investing heavily in R&D and technology. The authors argue that the choice of revenue model is critical in addressing this paradox and optimize the value capture dimension of business models. They conducted a study on two global railway industry manufacturing companies transitioning to digital servitization and found that customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships are key factors influencing the choice of revenue models. The study contributes to the existing literature on pricing and revenue models by extending beyond traditional approaches and offering an ecosystem perspective.",

The study also contributes to the pricing and revenue model literature by providing insights beyond the internal view of companies offering digital services. The ecosystem dimension of digital servitization is also explored, highlighting the importance of involving ecosystem actors. The study finds that the subscription model is the simplest and less risky option, while usage-based revenue models represent moderate risk, and performance models are seen as the most complex with the greatest value-adding potential.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This study proposes a framework for manufacturing companies to choose revenue models for digital services based on four sequential steps:\n\n1. Assessing the customer's digital readiness, which involves analyzing their digital service awareness, value co-creation, and contractual arrangements for digital services.\n2. Evaluating digital service sophistication by examining the type of data integration and analytics capabilities required for provisioning.\n3. Assessing digital ecosystem partnerships by evaluating the need for data exchange and security between ecosystem actors and their tendency to collaborate in co-developing digital services.\n4. Selecting a revenue model that meets the overall needs concerning customers' digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. The four revenue models considered are subscription-based, usage-based, performance-based, and hybrid models.\n\nThe proposed framework considers the interlinked nature of these factors and provides a structured approach for companies to make informed decisions about choosing revenue models for digital services. By following this framework, companies can identify the most appropriate revenue model that addresses their needs and expectations for digital services.",

The study also contributed to the pricing and revenue model literature by providing insights beyond the internal view of companies offering digital services. The ecosystem dimension of digital servitization was found critical in choosing performance-based revenue models. The study deepened the ecosystem dimensions, revealing a more comprehensive view of revenue models.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This study proposes a framework for manufacturing companies to choose revenue models for digital services. The framework includes four steps: assessing the customer's digital readiness, evaluating digital service sophistication, assessing digital ecosystem partnerships, and choosing the suitable revenue model. The first step involves analyzing the customer's digital awareness, value co-creation, and contractual arrangements. Based on this analysis, companies can select subscription models for less digitally mature customers or usage-based and performance-based models for more advanced customers. The second step entails evaluating the digital service orientation and data integration capabilities required for provisioning. Subscription models are suitable for basic digital services, while usage-based and performance-based models are more desirable for higher customization levels. The third step examines the need for data exchange and security between ecosystem actors and their collaboration in co-developing digital services. Performance-based models are appropriate when ecosystem actors participate in service delivery. Finally, the fourth step involves selecting a revenue model that meets the needs concerning customers' digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. The chosen revenue model should address the company's needs and expectations for digital services.",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships in delivering digital services. Ecosystem actors such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies play a crucial role in providing digital services. Data sharing and security, and co-development with ecosystem partners are two critical factors that enable the focal company to deliver digital services effectively. Liberal data sharing allows collaboration among ecosystem actors, enabling them to gather precise data from diverse sources, which is necessary to leverage accurate digital services. However, data sharing requires adequate infrastructure systems to protect sensitive data from vulnerabilities. Digital ecosystem partnerships underpin digital service co-development with ecosystem partners, involving exchanges and collaborations with different actors to provide and develop digital services. Close cooperation with ecosystem partners can lead to the development of advanced digital services, demonstrating a higher level of digital ecosystem partnership.",

    "summarize introduction": " This article discusses the importance of relationship marketing (RM) in business-to-business (B2B) settings during economic fluctuations. RM is critical in building and maintaining long-term relationships with customers, especially during times of economic contraction. The authors argue that firms need to adapt their RM strategies during a business cycle (BC) to ensure sustainability. They identify three key mechanisms that help suppliers perform well during economic swings: communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation. These mechanisms have direct and indirect effects on the supplier's performance. Additionally, the study examines how these relationship mechanisms differ during times of economic crisis and recovery. The findings suggest that there are clear strategies to manage a BC, which can be actionable and concrete. Finally, the study considers three outcome variables: selling price, cost-to-serve, and expectation of relationship continuity, at the customer level. Overall, the article highlights the significance of RM in B2B settings during economic fluctuations and provides valuable insights into how firms can adapt and thrive in such situations.",

    "summarize theoretical implications": " The article discusses the choice of revenue models for digital services in manufacturing companies undergoing digital transformation. The authors conducted a study to extend the current understanding of digital servitization and its influence on revenue models. They identified three factors that mitigate the \"digitalization paradox\" for manufacturing companies: customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. A four-step framework was proposed to inform the choice of revenue models for digital services, taking into account the customer-provider relationship, ecosystem actors, and the orientation of digital services. The study contributes to the literature on revenue models, pricing, and digital servitization by providing insights beyond the internal view of companies offering digital services.

The findings offer a more comprehensive view of revenue models for digital services, revealing a much more holistic perspective than previous studies.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This framework provides a four-step process for manufacturing companies to choose the right revenue model for their digital services. The first step is to assess the customer's digital readiness, including their awareness, value co-creation, and contractual arrangements. Based on this assessment, companies can choose between subscription models for less digitally advanced customers or usage-based and performance-based models for more advanced ones.\n\nThe second step involves evaluating the level of digital service sophistication required, considering factors like data integration and analytics capabilities. Subscription models are suitable for basic digital services, while usage-based models are more appropriate for intermediate levels of sophistication. Advanced digital services require performance-based models, which incorporate expertise into data integration and analytics.\n\nIn the third step, companies assess the need for data exchange and security between ecosystem actors and their willingness to collaborate in developing digital services. Basic digital services do not require ecosystem partnerships, but performance-based models do when actors participate in providing services.\n\nFinally, the fourth step involves selecting a revenue model based on the results of the previous three steps. No single optimal revenue model exists since each company's needs and expectations differ regarding digital services. These steps provide insights into making an informed decision about the most appropriate revenue model. The challenge lies in capturing interlinked elements, requiring",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships in delivering digital services. A digital ecosystem partnership refers to the collaboration between various actors in the ecosystem, such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies, to provide digital services. Two critical factors that enable the focal company to engage in digital ecosystem partnerships are data sharing and security, and co-development with ecosystem partners.\n\nData sharing is essential for digital services that require collaboration among ecosystem actors. However, there are challenges in sharing data due to concerns about data usage and cybersecurity threats. Ecosystem partners must work together to build adequate infrastructure systems that protect sensitive data from vulnerabilities.\n\nCo-development of digital services with ecosystem partners involves leveraging resources and skills to provide connected digital services. Lesser digital ecosystem partnerships may result in disconnected digital services that are not integrated with other actors in the ecosystem.\n\nThe article highlights the need for close cooperation between ecosystem partners to develop advanced digital services. An example of a successful digital ecosystem partnership is the creation of a cloud-based predictive maintenance solution led by Beta in partnership with global players in the tech sector.\n\nIn summary, digital ecosystem partnerships are crucial for delivering digital services and require collaboration, data",

    "summarize introduction": " Introduction: Relationship marketing (RM) has been well established in the literature, especially in business-to-business settings. However, the influence of increasing competition, customer complexity, and market turbulence creates a latent hazard for sustainability. Nordin and Ravald assert that a long-term relationship can suffer from changes in customer needs or supplier portfolio and strategy. Companies strive to manage and survive economic fluctuations, such as contraction facet of a business cycle with a fall of currency depreciation. Extant literature suggests that interorganizational learning is important for firms to access markets, develop marketing responses, and leverage process capabilities of partners. Williamson recognizes that bilateral relationships can minimize potential governance problems during exchange. Organizations can leverage human abilities to take initiative, cooperate, and learn to build new knowledge. Prior research on transformational relationship events has focused on ad hoc strategies and practitioners' attitudes and behaviors, neglecting environmental turbulence.

However, there is a lack of understanding regarding how firms should adapt their relationship mechanisms during a business cycle (BC). This study aims to address this gap by integrating RM process, BC, industrial setting, and emerging economy. Research Questions: \n\n1. How is RM linked to firm performance during a BC?\n2. What are the different mechanisms related to increased firm performance during both times of crisis and recovery? Methodology: Adopting RM and interorganizational learning theories, this study identifies relationship tenets that help suppliers sustain or increase performance from their B2B long-life customers during economic swings. Three outcome variables are considered: selling price, cost-to-serve, and expectation of relationship continuity, at the customer level. Contributions: This study contributes to the RM literature and BC literature by identifying key relationship process mechanisms explaining the divergence between managing B2B markets in times of economic crisis and recovery.

    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This article proposes a framework for manufacturing companies to choose suitable revenue models for digital services. The framework includes four steps: assessing customer digital readiness, evaluating digital service sophistication, assessing digital ecosystem partnerships, and selecting a revenue model. The first step involves analyzing the customer's digital awareness, value co-creation, and contractual arrangements for digital services. Based on this analysis, companies can choose between subscription, usage-based, or performance-based revenue models. The second step evaluates the digital service's sophistication, including data integration for business intelligence versus advanced analytics. Usage-based and performance-based revenue models are associated with higher levels of data integration and analytics. The third step assesses digital ecosystem partnerships, including data exchange and collaboration between actors. Performance-based revenue models are appropriate when there is significant collaboration between actors. Finally, the fourth step involves verifying and selecting a revenue model based on the previous assessments. The chosen revenue model should address the company's needs and expectations for digital services.",
