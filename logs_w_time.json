    "summarize introduction": " The article discusses the challenges faced by manufacturing companies in choosing appropriate revenue models for their digital services, as they transition from traditional product-based business models to digital servitization. The authors argue that the choice of revenue model is critical in capturing value from digital services and overcoming the \"digitalization paradox,\" where companies struggle to generate profits from their digital offerings. They identify three key factors that influence the choice of revenue models: customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. The study contributes to the existing literature on pricing and revenue models by moving beyond traditional approaches focused solely on the company's internal view and instead adopting an ecosystem perspective. The authors also provide a rich perspective on revenue models and the value-capture dimension of business models for digital services, and offer insights into how manufacturing companies can overcome the digitalization paradox.",
    "summarize managerial implications": " This section of the article discusses the managerial implications of the study's findings on revenue models for digital services. The authors argue that companies face challenges in selecting appropriate revenue models that align with their digital servitization goals, and that there are three key managerial implications to consider. Firstly, companies need to understand the nature and characteristics of various revenue models (subscription, usage-based, and performance-based) and choose the ones that best fit their business models. Secondly, managers must develop a deep understanding of the factors that influence their choice of revenue model, including customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Finally, manufacturing companies should increase multi-actor participation in digital servitization processes and adopt a flexible approach to negotiating with multiple stakeholders and adapting to changes over time.",
    "summarize theoretical implications": " The article discusses the choice of revenue models for digital services in manufacturing companies undergoing digital transformation. It identifies three influencing factors - customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships - and proposes a four-step framework to inform the choice of revenue models. The study contributes to the emerging literature on digital servitization by offering an in-depth perspective on the value-capturing dimension of digital services and extends previous research on revenue models by showing that each model contains unique characteristics that have been overlooked in previous studies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of involving ecosystem actors in the digital servitization process.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This framework provides a sequential four-step approach for manufacturing companies to choose suitable revenue models for their digital services. The first step involves evaluating the customer's digital readiness, including their awareness, co-creation potential, and contractual arrangements. Based on this analysis, companies can select subscription models for less digitally advanced customers or usage-based and performance-based models for more advanced ones.\n\nThe second step entails assessing the level of digital service sophistication required, considering factors like data integration and analytics capabilities. Subscription models suit basic digital services, while usage-based and performance-based models are preferred for advanced services with higher customization levels.\n\nIn the third step, the need for ecosystem partnerships is evaluated, considering data exchange and security between actors. Basic digital services do not require ecosystem participation and can employ subscription or usage-based models. In contrast, performance-based models are more appropriate when multiple actors collaborate in delivering digital services.\n\nFinally, the fourth step involves selecting a revenue model that aligns with the customer's digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and ecosystem partnerships. There is no single optimal choice of revenue model; instead, companies must make an informed decision based on their specific circumstances.",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships in delivering digital services. Ecosystem actors such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies must collaborate to provide a seamless digital experience. Data sharing and security are critical factors that enable the focal company to deliver digital services. Liberal data sharing allows collaboration among ecosystem actors, enabling them to gather precise data from diverse sources. However, data sharing is not always straightforward, and ecosystem partners must be willing to build adequate infrastructure systems to protect sensitive data. Digital service co-development with ecosystem partners is another essential aspect of digital ecosystem partnerships. It involves working together to leverage resources and skills to provide digital services. Closer cooperation between ecosystem partners can lead to more advanced digital services, as seen in the example of Beta's cloud-based predictive maintenance solution.",

    "summarize introduction": " The article discusses the challenges faced by manufacturing companies in selecting appropriate revenue models for their digital services, highlighting the \"digitalization paradox\" where companies struggle to capture profits from digital offerings despite investing in R&D and new technologies. The authors argue that the choice of revenue model is critical to optimal positioning of digital services and note a lack of research in this area, particularly for manufacturing companies undergoing digital transformation. They conducted a case study of two global railway industry manufacturers transitioning to digital servitization, finding three key factors influencing revenue model choice: customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. The study contributes to the literature by providing insights into overcoming the digitalization paradox, extending knowledge of digital servitization, and offering an ecosystem perspective on pricing and revenue models.",
    "summarize managerial implications": " The article discusses the challenges companies face in choosing appropriate revenue models for their digital services, highlighting the importance of understanding the nature and characteristics of different revenue models and factors that influence their choice. The authors suggest a framework for managers to make informed decisions on revenue models, considering customer digital readiness, service sophistication, and partnerships in the digital ecosystem. They also emphasize the need for continuous adaptation and multi-actor participation in the digital servitization process. The study aims to aid manufacturing companies in selecting revenue models that align with their digital servitization goals, enabling them to gradually accelerate their transition over the long run.",
    "summarize theoretical implications": " This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of factors influencing manufacturing companies' choices of revenue models for digital services. The researchers argued that as manufacturing companies transition from selling stand-alone products to advanced product\u2013service\u2013software offerings, understanding how to make positive profit gains is crucial. They extended the digital servitization literature by offering an in-depth perspective on the value-capturing dimension of digital services. They found that there are various options for revenue models, and each model contains characteristics such as payment type, risk level, and contractual orientation. These models include subscription, usage-based, and performance models. The study's three contributions include extending the digital servitization literature, identifying and describing influencing factors that mitigate the \"digitalization paradox\" for manufacturing companies, and providing insights beyond the internal view of companies offering digital services. The three factors they identified were customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Overall, this article provides valuable insight into revenue models for digital services.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This framework proposes four steps to help manufacturing companies choose suitable revenue models for their digital services. The first step involves evaluating the customer's digital readiness, including their awareness of digital services, ability to co-create value, and contractual arrangements. Depending on their level of digital readiness, companies can choose between subscription-based, usage-based, or performance-based revenue models. \n\nThe second step involves assessing the level of digital service sophistication required by the customer. Basic, intermediate, and advanced digital services may require different revenue models. For instance, smart lock systems would use a usage-based revenue model, while predictive maintenance solutions might employ a performance-based revenue model incorporating expertise into data integration and analytics.  \n\nThirdly, assessing digital ecosystem partnerships is essential, as the delivery of digital services may involve data sharing between the company and its customers, or even among multiple actors within an ecosystem. Subscription and usage-based models work well when only two parties are involved. Still, performance-based models become more fitting when multiple actors collaborate in delivering the service, requiring higher degrees of risk and reward sharing. \n\nFinally, after considering these factors, companies should select the most appropriate revenue model that balances the overall demands of consumers' digital preparedness, digital service complexity, and digital partnership agreements. These diagnoses provide insights into selecting the best revenue model for each particular situation since all three assessments work together to inform this decision. Companies must analyze their clients' digital maturity, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem involvement simultaneously to ensure they capture the essential components needed to make a practical choice of revenue model that fits their customers' specific needs and those of their ecosystem.",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships for the delivery of digital services. Ecosystem actors, such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies, need to work together to provide digital services. Data sharing and security are critical factors that enable the focal company to partner with ecosystem actors. Liberal data sharing allows collaboration among ecosystem actors, enabling them to gather precise data from diverse sources. Co-development with ecosystem partners is also essential for delivering digital services. The focal company must obtain data-sharing rights from railway operators to access information on trains and maintenance schedules. Ecosystem partners must be willing to build adequate infrastructure systems that protect sensitive data from vulnerabilities. Cyber-attacks can compromise data, so data sharing requires an infrastructure that ensures data safety through security standards and interoperable protocols. Digital ecosystem partnerships are underpinned by co-development with ecosystem partners, which consists of exchanges and collaborations with different actors to leverage resources and skills. External people are used for developing IT skills that adapt continuously to available technologies. Close cooperation between ecosystem partners creates advanced digital services.",
