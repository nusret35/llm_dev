    "summarize introduction": " The article discusses the challenges faced by manufacturing companies in choosing appropriate revenue models for their digital services, as they transition from traditional product-based business models to digital servitization. The authors argue that the choice of revenue model is critical in capturing value from digital services and overcoming the \"digitalization paradox,\" where companies struggle to generate profits from their digital offerings. They identify three key factors that influence the choice of revenue models: customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. The study contributes to the existing literature on pricing and revenue models by moving beyond traditional approaches focused solely on the company's internal view and instead adopting an ecosystem perspective. The authors also provide a rich perspective on revenue models and the value-capture dimension of business models for digital services, and offer insights into how manufacturing companies can overcome the digitalization paradox.",
    "summarize managerial implications": " This section of the article discusses the managerial implications of the study's findings on revenue models for digital services. The authors argue that companies face challenges in selecting appropriate revenue models that align with their digital servitization goals, and that there are three key managerial implications to consider. Firstly, companies need to understand the nature and characteristics of various revenue models (subscription, usage-based, and performance-based) and choose the ones that best fit their business models. Secondly, managers must develop a deep understanding of the factors that influence their choice of revenue model, including customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Finally, manufacturing companies should increase multi-actor participation in digital servitization processes and adopt a flexible approach to negotiating with multiple stakeholders and adapting to changes over time.",
    "summarize theoretical implications": " The article discusses the choice of revenue models for digital services in manufacturing companies undergoing digital transformation. It identifies three influencing factors - customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships - and proposes a four-step framework to inform the choice of revenue models. The study contributes to the emerging literature on digital servitization by offering an in-depth perspective on the value-capturing dimension of digital services and extends previous research on revenue models by showing that each model contains unique characteristics that have been overlooked in previous studies. Additionally, it highlights the importance of involving ecosystem actors in the digital servitization process.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This framework provides a sequential four-step approach for manufacturing companies to choose suitable revenue models for their digital services. The first step involves evaluating the customer's digital readiness, including their awareness, co-creation potential, and contractual arrangements. Based on this analysis, companies can select subscription models for less digitally advanced customers or usage-based and performance-based models for more advanced ones.\n\nThe second step entails assessing the level of digital service sophistication required, considering factors like data integration and analytics capabilities. Subscription models suit basic digital services, while usage-based and performance-based models are preferred for advanced services with higher customization levels.\n\nIn the third step, the need for ecosystem partnerships is evaluated, considering data exchange and security between actors. Basic digital services do not require ecosystem participation and can employ subscription or usage-based models. In contrast, performance-based models are more appropriate when multiple actors collaborate in delivering digital services.\n\nFinally, the fourth step involves selecting a revenue model that aligns with the customer's digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and ecosystem partnerships. There is no single optimal choice of revenue model; instead, companies must make an informed decision based on their specific circumstances.",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships in delivering digital services. Ecosystem actors such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies must collaborate to provide a seamless digital experience. Data sharing and security are critical factors that enable the focal company to deliver digital services. Liberal data sharing allows collaboration among ecosystem actors, enabling them to gather precise data from diverse sources. However, data sharing is not always straightforward, and ecosystem partners must be willing to build adequate infrastructure systems to protect sensitive data. Digital service co-development with ecosystem partners is another essential aspect of digital ecosystem partnerships. It involves working together to leverage resources and skills to provide digital services. Closer cooperation between ecosystem partners can lead to more advanced digital services, as seen in the example of Beta's cloud-based predictive maintenance solution.",

    "summarize introduction": " The article discusses the challenges faced by manufacturing companies in selecting appropriate revenue models for their digital services, highlighting the \"digitalization paradox\" where companies struggle to capture profits from digital offerings despite investing in R&D and new technologies. The authors argue that the choice of revenue model is critical to optimal positioning of digital services and note a lack of research in this area, particularly for manufacturing companies undergoing digital transformation. They conducted a case study of two global railway industry manufacturers transitioning to digital servitization, finding three key factors influencing revenue model choice: customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. The study contributes to the literature by providing insights into overcoming the digitalization paradox, extending knowledge of digital servitization, and offering an ecosystem perspective on pricing and revenue models.",
    "summarize managerial implications": " The article discusses the challenges companies face in choosing appropriate revenue models for their digital services, highlighting the importance of understanding the nature and characteristics of different revenue models and factors that influence their choice. The authors suggest a framework for managers to make informed decisions on revenue models, considering customer digital readiness, service sophistication, and partnerships in the digital ecosystem. They also emphasize the need for continuous adaptation and multi-actor participation in the digital servitization process. The study aims to aid manufacturing companies in selecting revenue models that align with their digital servitization goals, enabling them to gradually accelerate their transition over the long run.",
    "summarize theoretical implications": " This study aimed to contribute to the understanding of factors influencing manufacturing companies' choices of revenue models for digital services. The researchers argued that as manufacturing companies transition from selling stand-alone products to advanced product\u2013service\u2013software offerings, understanding how to make positive profit gains is crucial. They extended the digital servitization literature by offering an in-depth perspective on the value-capturing dimension of digital services. They found that there are various options for revenue models, and each model contains characteristics such as payment type, risk level, and contractual orientation. These models include subscription, usage-based, and performance models. The study's three contributions include extending the digital servitization literature, identifying and describing influencing factors that mitigate the \"digitalization paradox\" for manufacturing companies, and providing insights beyond the internal view of companies offering digital services. The three factors they identified were customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Overall, this article provides valuable insight into revenue models for digital services.",
    "summarize framework for choosing revenue models in digital services": " This framework proposes four steps to help manufacturing companies choose suitable revenue models for their digital services. The first step involves evaluating the customer's digital readiness, including their awareness of digital services, ability to co-create value, and contractual arrangements. Depending on their level of digital readiness, companies can choose between subscription-based, usage-based, or performance-based revenue models. \n\nThe second step involves assessing the level of digital service sophistication required by the customer. Basic, intermediate, and advanced digital services may require different revenue models. For instance, smart lock systems would use a usage-based revenue model, while predictive maintenance solutions might employ a performance-based revenue model incorporating expertise into data integration and analytics.  \n\nThirdly, assessing digital ecosystem partnerships is essential, as the delivery of digital services may involve data sharing between the company and its customers, or even among multiple actors within an ecosystem. Subscription and usage-based models work well when only two parties are involved. Still, performance-based models become more fitting when multiple actors collaborate in delivering the service, requiring higher degrees of risk and reward sharing. \n\nFinally, after considering these factors, companies should select the most appropriate revenue model that balances the overall demands of consumers' digital preparedness, digital service complexity, and digital partnership agreements. These diagnoses provide insights into selecting the best revenue model for each particular situation since all three assessments work together to inform this decision. Companies must analyze their clients' digital maturity, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem involvement simultaneously to ensure they capture the essential components needed to make a practical choice of revenue model that fits their customers' specific needs and those of their ecosystem.",
    "summarize digital ecosystem partnership": " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships for the delivery of digital services. Ecosystem actors, such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies, need to work together to provide digital services. Data sharing and security are critical factors that enable the focal company to partner with ecosystem actors. Liberal data sharing allows collaboration among ecosystem actors, enabling them to gather precise data from diverse sources. Co-development with ecosystem partners is also essential for delivering digital services. The focal company must obtain data-sharing rights from railway operators to access information on trains and maintenance schedules. Ecosystem partners must be willing to build adequate infrastructure systems that protect sensitive data from vulnerabilities. Cyber-attacks can compromise data, so data sharing requires an infrastructure that ensures data safety through security standards and interoperable protocols. Digital ecosystem partnerships are underpinned by co-development with ecosystem partners, which consists of exchanges and collaborations with different actors to leverage resources and skills. External people are used for developing IT skills that adapt continuously to available technologies. Close cooperation between ecosystem partners creates advanced digital services.",

The authors suggest a 2x3 matrix with six quadrants, each representing a different combination of the three RM mechanisms: communication openness (COM), technical involvement (INV), and customer value anticipation (CVA).\n\nThe six quadrants are named based on the empirical results and are as follows:\n\n1. Value anticipation based on distant communication - increasing PR during an economic crisis by reducing INV while enhancing CVA.\n2. Cost-oriented joint collaboration - reducing CTS during an economic crisis by establishing a strong INV and focusing on cost-reducing opportunities.\n3. Dyadic top management consensus - enhancing EC during an economic crisis by exploiting TMC and diminishing INV.\n4. Generative hard work - increasing PR during times of economic recovery by leveraging INV, TMC, and CVA.\n5. Controlled technical deescalating - reducing CTS during times of recovery by carefully deescalating INV.\n6. Integrated optimal balance - enhancing EC during times of recovery by integrating efforts on INV, CVA, and TMC.\n\nThe authors recommend that suppliers focus on the variable(s) they can most efficiently leverage to achieve their goals, while also considering the potential impact of each RM mechanism on other goals. Overall, the study provides insights into the managerial implications of the proposed RM mechanisms and offers practical strategies for firms to achieve their goals during times of economic crisis and recovery.",

The authors investigate the role of relational mechanisms, such as communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation, in mitigating the negative impact of economic fluctuations on B2B relationships. They also explore how these mechanisms can help transform the inherent tension created in a business contraction into effective learning for adapting the relationship during economic crises.\n\nThe study contributes to the existing literature on B2B relationships and economic swings by providing empirical evidence on the key role of customer value anticipation in navigating economic downturns. It also extends the dialectical view on buyer-seller relationships by showing that high levels of technical involvement are not always required to manage tension between suppliers and buyers.\n\nAdditionally, the study highlights the importance of investing in relationships during economic downturns to consider forward-looking measures such as customer lifetime value. The findings suggest that organizations can advantage other structural knowledge generation sources since challenges to prosperity can be idiosyncratic to the dyad and its business network, especially in emerging markets.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights for B2B suppliers on how to navigate economic downturns and maintain their relationships with customers.

The study identified three key RM mechanisms that differ in their effectiveness during times of economic crisis versus recovery: communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation.\n4. The six quadrants of the proposed RM matrix are: Value anticipation based on distant communication, Cost-oriented joint collaboration, Dyadic top management consensus, Generative hard work, Controlled technical deescalating, and Integrated optimal balance.\n5. Suppliers should focus on the variable(s) they can most efficiently leverage to achieve their goals while considering the potential impact of each RM mechanism on other goals.\n6. The study extends the dialectical view on buyer-seller relationships by showing that high levels of technical involvement are not always required to manage tension between suppliers and buyers.\n7. Organizations should invest in relationships during economic downturns to consider forward-looking measures such as customer lifetime value.\n8. The findings suggest that organizations can advantage other structural knowledge generation sources since challenges to prosperity can be idiosyncratic to the dyad and its business network, especially in emerging markets.\n9. This research provides valuable insights for B2B suppliers on how to navigate economic downturns and maintain their relationships with customers.\n10. The study underscores the significance of extending BC marketing literature outside the often-used U.S. environment and contributing to the vision for this century's marketing research to be all about emerging markets.",

The authors suggest a 2x3 matrix with six quadrants, each representing a different combination of the three RM mechanisms: Communication Openness (COM), Technical Involvement (INV), and Customer Value Anticipation (CVA). Each quadrant is named based on the empirical results and corresponds to a specific RM strategy.\n\nThe first quadrant, \"Value anticipation based on distant communication,\" focuses on increasing the selling price (PR) during an economic crisis. Suppliers should reduce their technical involvement with customers while fostering communication to learn about their needs and wants. This allows suppliers to establish a high level of communication without increasing technical collaboration.\n\nThe second quadrant, \"Cost-oriented joint collaboration,\" aims to reduce the cost-to-serve (CTS) during an economic crisis. Suppliers should establish a strong INV with customers, focusing on cost-reducing opportunities and generating savings for both actors.\n\nThe third quadrant, \"Dyadic top management consensus,\" focuses on enhancing the expectation of continuity (EC) during an economic crisis. Suppliers should exploit Top Management Consensus (TMC) with customers, nudging top managers to reach consensus on how to face the economic crisis together.\n\nThe fourth quadrant, \"Generative hard work,\" aims to increase the PR during times of economic recovery. Suppliers should leverage their ability to be technically involved with customers, have compatible top managers, and anticipate customer value altogether.\n\nThe fifth quadrant, \"Controlled technical deescalating,\" focuses on reducing the CTS during times of economic recovery. Suppliers should carefully deescalate INV, as neither CVA nor TMC has an influence on accomplishing this goal.\n\nFinally, the sixth quadrant, \"Integrated optimal balance,\" aims to enhance the EC during times of economic recovery.

    "summarize introduction": " Introduction: Relationship marketing (RM) has been well established in business-to-business (B2B) settings, especially during economic contraction. However, the influence of increasing competition, customer complexity, and market turbulence creates a latent hazard for sustainability. Nordin and Ravald assert that a long-term relationship can suffer from changes in customer needs or supplier strategy. Companies strive to manage and survive economic fluctuations, such as a drop in GDP growth and local currency depreciation. Extant literature on RM suggests that interorganizational learning is important for firms to access markets, develop marketing responses, and leverage process capabilities of partners. Williamson recognizes that bilateral relationships can minimize potential governance problems during the exchange. Organizations have an advantage over markets and hierarchy by leveraging human abilities to take initiative, cooperate, and learn. Prior research on transformational relationship events has generally focused on ad hoc strategies and practitioners' attitudes and behaviors, neglecting environmental turbulence impact. This article integrates a BC, an industrial setting, and an emerging economy, addressing the research gap and contributing to understanding buyer\u2013seller relationships during economic swings. It adopts RM and interorganizational learning theories to identify relationship tenets helping suppliers find ways to sust",
