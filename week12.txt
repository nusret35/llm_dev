1 Outline 
Today we’ll go over some of the details from last class and make precise many details that were skipped. We’ll 
then go on to prove Fritz John’s theorem. Finally , we will start discussing the Brunn-Mink owski inequalit y. 
2 Separating Hyp erplanes 
Given a convex body K ⊆ Rn and a point p,a separating hyperplane for K and p is a hyperplane that has 
K on one side of it and p on the other. More formally , for a vector ν, the hyperplane H = {x|ν · x =1} is a 
separating hyperplane for K and p if 
1. ν · x ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K, and 
2. ν · p ≥ 1. 
Note that if we replace the right hand side of both the above conditions by 0 or any other constan t, we 
get an equivalent formulation. 
We call a separating hyperplane H a strongly separating hyperplane if the second inequalit y is strict. 
Last time, we sketched a proof of the following theorem: 
Theorem 1 (Separating Hyp erplane Theorem) If K is a convex body and p is a point not containe d 
in K, then ther e exists a hyperplane that strongly separates them. 
We’ll use the above result to show why the polar of the polar of a convex body is the body itself. Recall 
that for a convex body K, we had deﬁned its polar K∗ to be {p|k · p ≤ 1∀k ∈ K}. 
Theorem 2 Let K be a convex body. Then K∗∗ = K. 
Pro of We know that K∗ = {p|k · p ≤ 1∀k ∈ K}. Similarly K∗∗ = {y|p · y ≤ 1∀p ∈ k∗}. Let y be any 
point in K. Then, by the deﬁnition of the polar, for all p ∈ K∗ we have that p · y ≤ 1. The deﬁnition of the 
polar of K∗ implies that y ∈ K∗∗ . Since this is true for every y ∈ K, we conclude that K ⊆ K∗∗ . 
The other direction of the proof is the nontrivial one and we’ll have to use the convexity of the body and 
the separating hyperplane theorem. Suppose that we can ﬁnd a y ∈ K∗∗ such that y/∈ K. Since y ∈ K∗∗ , 
we have that p · y ≤ 1 for all p ∈ K∗ . Since y ∈/negationslashK, there exists a strongly separating hyperplane for y and 
K. Let it be H = {x|v · x =1}. By the deﬁnition of separating hyperplane, we have v · k ≤ 1 for all k ∈ K. 
Hence, v ∈ K∗ . Also, v · y> 1 (since H is a separating hyperplane), and we just showed that v ∈ K∗ . This 
contradicts our assumption that y ∈ K∗∗ . Hence K∗∗ ⊆ K. 
3 Banac h–Mazur Distance 
Recall from last time the deﬁnition of the Banac h–Mazur distance between two convex bodies: 
Deﬁnition 3 Let K and L be two convex bodies. The Banach–Mazur distanc e d(K,L) is the least positive 
d ∈ R for which ther e is a linear image L/prime of L such that L/prime ⊆ K ⊆ dL/prime, wher e dL/prime is the convex body 
obtaine d by multiplying every vector in L/prime by the scalar d. 
12-1 4 Figure 1: Deﬁning the distance between K and L. 
Observ e that the above deﬁnition takes into consideration only the intrinsic shape of the body, and it is 
independen t of any particular choice of coordinate system. Also observ e that the Banac h–Mazur distance is 
symmetric in its input argumen ts. If L/prime ⊆ K ⊆ dL/prime, then by scaling everything by d, we get that dL/prime ⊆ dK. 
Hence K ⊆ dL/prime ⊆ dK, which implies the symmetry property. 
Fritz John’s Theorem 
Let Bn 
2 denote the n-dimensional unit ball. For any two convex bodies K and K/prime, let d(K,K/prime) denote 
the Banac h–Mazur distance between them. In the rest of this lecture, we will state and prove Fritz John’s 
theorem. 
√Theorem 4 For any n-dimensional, origin-symmetric convex body K, we have d(K,B2 n) ≤ n. 
In other words, the theorem states that for every origin-symmetric convex body K, there exists some √ellipsoid E such that E ⊆ K ⊆ nE. We will prove that the ellipsoid of maximal volume that is contained 
in K will satisfy the above containmen t. √Informally , the theorem says that up to a factor of n, every convex body looks like a ball. The above √bound of n is tight for the cube. If we didn’t require the condition that K is origin symmetric, then the 
bound would be n, which would be tight for a simplex. 
The theorem can also be rephrased as the following: there exists a change of the coordinate basis for √which Bn 
2 ⊆ K ⊆ nBn 
2 . 
4.1 A sligh tly stronger version of the Fritz John Theorem 
We will actually state and prove a more technical and slightly stronger version of the Fritz John theorem 
that implies our previous formulation. From now on, we assume that all the convex bodies we consider are 
origin-symmetric. 
Theorem 5 Let K be an origin-symmetric convex body. Then K contains a unique ellipsoid of maximal 
volume. Mor eover, this largest ellipsoid is Bn 
2 if and only if the following conditions hold: 
• Bn 
2 ⊆ K 
Ther e are unit vectors u1,u2,...,u on the boundary of K and positive real numb ers c1,c2,...,c • m m

m 2 22. For all vectors x, we have i=1 ci/angbracketleftx,ui/angbracketright= |x|. It is not hard to show that this condition is 
m Tequivalent to the requir ement that i=1 ciuiui =Idn, wher e Idn is the n×n identity matrix. 
Since the ui are unit vectors, they are points on the convex body K that also belong to the sphere B2 n . 
mAlso, the ﬁrst identity, i.e. i=1 ciui =0, is actually redundan t, since for origin-symmetric bodies it can be 
derived from the second identity. This is because for every ui, its reﬂection in the origin (namely −ui)is 
also contained in K ∩B2 n; further we can take the constan ts in the second identity corresp onding to ui and 
−ui to be the same, and this establishes the ﬁrst equation. 
The second identity says that the contact points of the sphere with K act somewhat like an orthonormal 
basis. They can be weighted so that they are completely isotropic. In other words, the points are not 
concen trated near some proper subspace, but are pretty evenly spread out in all directions. Together they 
mean that the ui can be weighted so that their center of mass is the origin and their inertia tensor is the 
identity. Also, a simple rank argumen t shows that there need to be at least n such contact points, since the 
second identity can only hold for x in the span of the ui. 
Note that Theorem 4 easily follows from Theorem 5. Indeed, assume without loss of generalit y that B2 n 
is the ellipsoid of maximal volume contained in K. We can make this assumption since the particular choice √of basis is not important for the proof. We need to show that B2 n ⊆K ⊆ nB2 n . Now, for all x ∈K,we 
have x·ui ≤1 for all i. Hence, |x|2 = � ci(x·ui)2 ≤ � ci. In the course of the proof below, we will see that � √ √ ci = n. This shows that |x|≤ n, and hence K ⊆ nB2 n . 
Thus, once we prove Theorem 5, we will have shown the existence of an ellipsoid E such that 
√ E ⊆K ⊆ nE. 
4.2 Pro of of John’s Theorem 
As part of the proof Theorem 5, we will prove the following things: 
1. If there exist contact points {ui}as required in the statemen t of Theorem 5, then Bn is the unique 2 
ellipsoid of maximal volume that is contained in K. 
2. If Bn is the unique ellipsoid of maximal volume that is contained in K, then there exist points {ui}2 
such that they satisfy the two identities in Theorem 5. 
To prove the ﬁrst statemen t, suppose that we are given unit vectors u1,u2,...,u m on the boundary of 
mK and positive real numbers c1,c2,...,c m such that i=1 ciui =0, and for all vectors x, it is the case that 
m 2 2 
i=1 ci/angbracketleftx,ui/angbracketright= |x|. We wish to show that Bn is the unique ellipsoid of maximal volume that is contained 2 
in K. Observ e that it suﬃces to show that among all axis-aligned ellipsoids contained in K, B2 n is the unique 
ellipsoid of maximal volume. This is because what we are trying to prove doesn’t mention any basis and is 
only in terms of dot products. Hence, since the statemen t will remain true under rotations, proving it for 
axis-aligned ellipsoids is enough. 
For each ui it is the case that ui ·k ≤1 for all k ∈K, Hence ui ∈K∗ . Let E be any axis-aligned ellipsoid 
such that E ⊆K. Then K∗ ⊆E∗ . Hence {u1,u2,...,u m}⊆E∗ . Since E is axis-aligned, it is of the form 
2

i 
We also have that Vol(E)/Vol(B2 n)= n αi. Therefore, to show that Vol(E) < Vol(B2 n), we must � i=1 
show that n αi <1 for any such E that is not Bn 
i=1 � 2 . �� ��Observ e that E∗ = {y| n α22 ≤1}. Now, since ui ·ui =1, we have Tr m T = n 
i=1 i yi i=1 ciuiui i=1 ci. 
Since Tr(Idn)= n, this implies that n
i=1 ci = n. 
Let ej denote the vector which hasa1i nthe jth coordinate and 0 in the other coordinates. Clearly 
/angbracketleftui,ej /angbracketrightis the jth coordinate of ui. For 1 ≤i≤m, since ui ∈E∗, we get that �

and by the above we know that this is at most n. Further, by condition 2 of Theorem 5, we know that

i=1 ci/angbracketleftui,ej /angbracketright2 = |ej |2 = 1. Therefore, we get j n α2 ≤ n. By the AM-GM inequalit y, we get that j=1 P

For the second part, assume that we are given that B2 n is the unique ellipsoid of maximal volume that is 
contained in K. We want to show that for some m, there exist ci and ui for 1 ≤ i ≤ m (as in the statemen t 
mof Theorem 5), such that for all vectors x, �
i=1 ci/angbracketleftx,ui/angbracketright2 = |x|2 . Again, this is equivalent to showing that 
m 
ciuiuiT =Idn . 
i=1 
We already observ ed that for origin-symmetric bodies, the condition that �m
i=1 ciui = 0 is implied by the 
previous requiremen t. 
Let Ui = uiuT
i . Also, observ e that we can view the space of n × n matrices as a vector space of dimension 
n2 . Hence we can parametrize the space of n × n matrices by Rn 2 . Thus, m
i=1 ciuiuT
i =Idn for ci > 0 
means that Idn /n is in the convex hull of the Ui (if the identity holds, we know that the ci are positive and 
sum to n). 
mIf we cannot ﬁnd ci,ui such that �
i=1 ciuiuT
i =Idn, it means that Idn /n is not in the convex hull of 
the Ui. Hence, there must be a hyperplane in the space of matrices that separates Idn /n from the convex 
hull of the Ui. 
2For two n×n matrices A and B, let A•B denote their dot product in Rn , i.e. A•B = i,j Aij ·Bij . Thus, 
the separating hyperplane gives a matrix H such that A • H ≥ 1 for all A ∈ conv(Ui) and (Idn /n) • H< 1. 
Let t =Tr(H)= H • Idn. Let H/prime = H − (t/n)(Idn). Then (Idn /n) • H/prime = (Idn /n) • (H − (t/n)Idn)= 
t/n − ((Idn /n) • (t/n)Idn) = 0. Similarly , since Tr(A) = 1 for all A in conv(Ui), we get that A • H/prime > 0. 
Hence, H/prime is such that: 
1. Tr(H/prime)=0, and 
2. H/prime • (uiuiT ) > 0 for all i. 
Now, let Eδ = x ∈ Rn|xT (Idn +δH/prime)x ≤ 1 . For all i, we have uT (Idn +δH/prime)ui =1+ δuiT H/primeui, which i 
is greater than 1 since uT
i H/primeui > 0= H/prime • (uiuT
i ) > 0. Hence ui ∈/negationslashEδ . Also, since H/prime • (uiuT
i ) > 0 for all i, 
by continuity, there exists /epsilon1> 0 such that for all vectors w in the /epsilon1-neigh borhood of the set of all ui satisfy 
H/prime • (wwT ) > 0. Hence, by the previous argumen t, any such w is not contained in Eδ. 
Note that when δ = 0, we get the unit ball B2 n . For every δ> 0 we have that all w in the /epsilon1-neigh borhood 
of the contact points of B2 n are not contained in Eδ. Hence, as we increase δ continuously starting from 0, 
the continuity of the transformation of Eδ implies that for suﬃcien tly small δ, boundary( K) ∩ Eδ = ∅. 
Hence ∃/epsilon1/prime > 0suchthat(1 + /epsilon1/prime)Eδ ⊆ K. Therefore, to conclude the proof, it suﬃces to show that 
Vol(Eδ) ≥ Vol(B2 n), which gives give us a contradiction (as (1 + /epsilon1/prime)Eδ is an ellipse of volume larger than B2 n 
contained in K). 
Let λ1,λ2,...,λ n be the eigenvalues of Idn +δH/prime . Since Vol(Eδ)=( �
in 
=1 λi)−1, to show that Vol(Eδ) ≥ 
Vol(B2 n), we need to show that �
in 
=1 λi ≤ 1. However we know that �
in 
=1 λi = Tr(Idn +δH/prime) = Tr(Idn)= n. 
By the AM-GM inequalit y, ( �
in 
=1 λi)1/n ≤ ( �
in 
=1 λi)/n =1. Hence in 
=1 λi ≤ 1. This concludes the proof 
of part 2.

6 Sketch of a Simpler Pro of 
If we just wish to prove the existence of an ellipse E that satisﬁes the conditions of Fritz John’s Theorem 
without actually characterizing it, then the picture below suggests an alternativ e and possibly simpler proof 
of the result. √If any point of K is more than n distance away from the origin, then we can ﬁnd an ellipse of larger 
volume than B2 n that is contained in K. 
Figure 2: A simpler proof of the “Rounding” result. 
The Brunn-Mink owski Inequalit y 
Deﬁnition 6 For A,B ∈Rn , the Minkowski sum A ⊕B is given by 
A ⊕B = {a + b|a ∈A,b ∈B}. 
The Minkowski sum can be deﬁned for any subsets of Rn , but it is nicely behaved if A and B are convex. 
Intuitively, the Minkowski sum is obtained by moving one of the sets around the boundary of the other one. 
The Brunn-Mink owski inequalit y, which relates the volume of A ⊕B to the volumes of A and B, implies 
many important theorems in convex geometry . The goal is to bound Vol(A ⊕B) in terms of Vol(A) and 
Vol(B). The following are some loose bounds that can be simply veriﬁed. 
Fact 7 Vol(A ⊕B) ≥max{Vol(A), Vol(B)} 
Pro of Let a ∈A. We have {a}⊕B ⊆A ⊕B, by deﬁnition. Hence, 
Vol(A ⊕B) ≥Vol({a}⊕B)=Vol(B). 
Similarly , Vol(A ⊕B) ≥Vol(B). 
Fact 8 Vol(A ⊕B) ≥Vol(A)+Vol(B) 
Pro of By moving one of the sets around the other one (summing the extreme points), we can get disjoin t 
copies of A and B in A ⊕B. 
The bound given by Fact 8 is loose. To see that, consider the case that A = B. In this case, A ⊕A =2A 
and hence, Vol(A ⊕A)=2n Vol(A). So the volume of A ⊕A grows exponentially with n, while the lower 
bound given in the above fact do not. This suggests taking the n-th roots and still get a valid bound. Let 
us ﬁrst prove it for boxes.

Vol(A⊕ B)1/n ≥ Vol(A)1/n + Vol(B)1/n.
Pro of Let A have sides of length a1,...,a n and B have sides of length b1,...,b n. It directly follows from 
the deﬁnition of Minkowski sums that A⊕ B has sides of length a1 + b1,...,a n + bn. 
We just need to show the following: 
Vol(A)1/n + Vol(B)1/n

Next time, we will prove the Brunn-Mink owski inequalit y for more general bodies, and study some of its 
applications.
