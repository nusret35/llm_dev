Lattice 
Deﬁnition. (Lattice) Given n linearly indep enden t vectors b1, ,bn ∈ Rm, the lattic e generated by them ··· 
is deﬁned as L(b1,b2, ··· bn)= { xibi|xi ∈ Z}. We refer to b1, ··· ,bn as a basis of the lattice. Equiv alently, 
if we deﬁne B as the m × n matrix whose columns are b1, ,bn, then the lattice generated by B is ··· 
L(B)= L(b1,b2, ··· ,bn)= {Bx|x ∈ Zn}. We say that the rank of the lattice is n and its dimension is m. 
If n = m, the lattice is called a full-rank lattice. 
It is easy to see that, L is a lattice if and only if L is a discrete subgroup of (Rn , +). 
Remark. We will mostly consider full-rank lattices, as the more general case is not substan tially diﬀeren t. 
Example. The lattice generated by (1, 0)T and (0, 1)T is Z2, the lattice of all integers points (see Figure 1(a)). 
This basis is not unique: for example, (1, 1)T and (2, 1)T also generate Z2 (see Figure 1 (b)). Yet another 
basis of Z2 is given by (2005, 1)T ; (2006, 1)T . On the other hand, (1, 1)T , (2, 0)T is not a basis of Z2: 
instead, it generates the lattice of all integer points whose coordinates sum to an even number (see Figure 
1(c)). All the examples so far were of full-rank lattices. An example of a lattice that is not full is L((2, 1)T ) 
(see Figure 1(d)). It is of dimension 2 and of rank 1. Finally , the lattice Z = L((1)) is a one-dimensional 
full-rank lattice.

Deﬁnition.  For matrix  B, P (B)= {Bx|x ∈ [0, 1)n} is the fundamental  parallelepip ed of B. 
Examples  of fundamen tal parallelepip eds are the gray areas  in Figure  1. For a full rank lattice  L(B), 
P (B) tiles Rn in the pattern  L(B), in the sense  that Rn = {P (B)+ x : x ∈ L(B)}; see Figure  2.

In Figure  1, we saw that not every set of n linearly  indep enden t vectors  B in a rank  n full-rank  lattice  
Λ is a basis  of Λ. The fundamen tal parallelepip ed characterizes  exactly  when  B is a basis:  
Lemma.  Let Λ be a rank n full-rank lattic e and B an invertible  n × n matrix.  Then  B is a basis (of Λ) if 
and only if P (B) ∩ Λ= {0}. 
Proof. “ ” is obvious:  Λ only contains  elemen ts with  integer  coordinates  under  B, and 0 is the only ⇒
elemen t of P (B) with  integer  coordinates.  
For “ ⇐ ”, need  to show that any lattice point x = By satisﬁes  yi ∈ Z. Note  that By� with  yi�= yi −�yi�
is a lattice  point in P (B). By our assumption  By� = 0, ie yi ∈ Z. 
It is natural  to ask when  are two invertible  matices  A, B equivalent  bases,  ie bases  of the same  lattice.  It 
turns  out that this happ ens if and only if A, B are related  by a unimo dular  matrix.  
Deﬁnition.  A square  matrix  U is unimo dular  if all entries  are integer  and det(U)= ±1. 
Lemma.  U is unimo dular iﬀ U−1 is unimo dular. 
Proof. Supp ose U is unimo dular . Clearly  U−1 has ±1 determinan t. To see that U−1 has integer  entries,  
note  that they  are simply  signed  minors  of U divided  by det(U). 
Lemma.  Nonsingular  matric es B1,B2 are equivalent  bases if and only if B2 = B1U for some  unimo dular  
matrix  U. 
Proof. “ ”: Since  each column  of B1 has integer  coordinates  under  B2, B1 = B2U for some  integer  matrix  ⇒
U. Similarly  B2 = B1V for some  integer  matrix  V . Hence  B1 = B1VU, ie VU = I. Since  V, U are both 
integer  matrices,  this means  that det(U)= ±1, as required.  
“ ”: Note  that each column  of B2 is contained  in L(B1) and vice versa.  ⇐
Corollary . Nonsingular  matric es B1,B2 are equivalent  if and only if one can be obtaine d from the other  by 
the following  operations  on columns:  
1. bi ↔ bi + kbj for some  k ∈ Z 
2. bi ↔ bj 
3. bi ←−bi 
Now that it is clear  that bases  of a lattice  have the same  absolute  determinan t, we can proceed to deﬁne  the 
determinan t of lattice:  
Deﬁnition.  (Determinan t of lattice)  Let L = L(B) be a lattice  of rank n. We deﬁne  the determinant  of L, 
denoted  det(L), as the n-dimensional  volume  of P (B), ie det(L)= det(BT B). In particular  if L is a full 
rank  lattice,  det(L)= |det(B)|.

Deﬁnition. The dual Λ∗ of lattice Λ is {x ∈ Rn : ∀v ∈ Λ,x v ∈ Z}.· 
Equiv alently, the dual can be viewed as the set of linear functionals from Λ to Z. 
Figure 3: Dual lattice 
Deﬁnition. For matrix B, its the dual basis B∗ is the unique basis that satisﬁes 
1. span(B )= span(B∗) 
2. BT B∗ = I 
Fact. (L(B))∗ = L(B∗). 
Fact. (Λ∗)∗ =Λ. 
Fact. det(Λ∗)= det1
(Λ) . 
Shortest vectors and successiv e minima 
One basic parameter of a lattice is the length of the shortest nonzero vector in the lattice, denoted λ1. How 
about the second shortest? We are not interested in the second/third/etc shortest vectors which happ en to 
be simply scaler multiples of the shortest vector. Instead, one requires that the next “minim um” increases 
the dimension of the space spanned: 
Deﬁnition. The ith successive minimum of lattice Λ, λi(Λ), is deﬁned to be inf{r| dim(span(Λ ∩ B¯(0,r)) ≥
i}. 
Figure 4: λ1(Λ) = 1, λ2Λ=2.3 
The following theorem, due to Blichﬁeld , has various importan t consequences, and in particular can be 
used to bound λ1. 
Theorem. (Blichﬁeld) For any full-rank lattic e Λ and (measurable) set S ⊆ Rn with vol(S) > det(Λ), there 
exist distinct z1,z2 ∈ S such that z1 − z2 ∈ Λ.

Figure 5). Since S =  Sx we conclude that vol(S)= � vol(Sx). Let Sˆx denote {z − x : z ∈ Sx}. x∈Λ� x∈Λ 
Then vol(Sˆx)= vol(Sx), ie x∈Λ vol(Sˆx)= vol(S) > vol(P (B)). Therefore, there must exist nondisjoin t Sˆx 
and Sˆy for x =�y. Consider any nonzero z ∈ Sˆx ∩ Sˆy , then z + x, z + y ∈ S and x − y =(z + x) − (z + y) ∈ Λ, 
as required. 
Figure 5: Blichﬁeld’s theorem 
As a corollary of Blichﬁeld’s theorem, we obtain the following theorem due to Mink owski, which says 
that any large enough centrally-symmetric convex set contains a nonzero lattice point. A set S is centrally-
symmetric if it is closed under negation. It is easy to see that the theorem is false if we drop either of the 
central-symmetry or the convexity requiremen t. 
Theorem. (Minkowski) Let Λ be a full-rank lattic e of rank n. Any centrally-symmetric convex set S with 
vol(S) > 2ndet(Λ) contains a nonzer o lattic e point.
