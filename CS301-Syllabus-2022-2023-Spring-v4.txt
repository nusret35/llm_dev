CS301 – Algorithms
2022-2023 Spring
Syllabus
Version 4
We may have to revise the course plan according to the countrywide reassessment to be made regarding
higher education. This is expected to happen at the beginning of April. The content to be delivered is certain
but the method of course delivery, the number and dates of exams, and some other details are subject to
change.
