      "Summary of introduction: \n",
      " This article discusses the importance of relationship marketing (RM) in business-to-business settings during economic contraction and expansion. It highlights the need for firms to adapt their RM strategies during economic fluctuations, citing previous research that has focused on general strategies for managing relationship performance. The authors argue that there is a lack of research integrating a business cycle (BC), an industrial setting, and an emerging economy, and aim to contribute to this body of research by studying the impact of RM process on determining the specific contribution of long-life customers in emerging economies during periods of contraction and expansion. They identify key relationship process mechanisms that help suppliers sustain or increase performance from their B2B long-life customers during economic swings, including communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation. The article concludes by emphasizing the timeliness and necessity of this study, especially in light of current crises such as the coronavirus situation and Ukraine conflict.\n",
      "Summary of managerial implications: \n",
      " This section discusses the managerial implications of the proposed Relationship Mechanism (RM) mechanisms for business-to-business (B2B) relationships during economic crises and recoveries. The authors suggest a 2x3 matrix with six quadrants, each representing a different combination of the three RM mechanisms: communication openness (COM), technical involvement (INV), and customer value anticipation (CVA). Each quadrant is named based on the empirical results and includes strategies for effectively managing each quadrant. The strategies include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Value anticipation based on distant communication: Suppliers should reduce INV with customers while increasing CVA during economic crises. They can use communication media like email and telephone to establish high levels of communication without increasing technical collaboration.\n",
      "2. Cost-oriented joint collaboration: During economic crises, suppliers should establish strong INV with customers while keeping ideas associated with customer value for future times. This can be achieved by concentrating technical work on cost-reducing opportunities and generating savings for both actors.\n",
      "3. Dyadic top management consensus: To enhance expectation of continuity (EC) during economic crises, suppliers should exploit top management consensus with customers, nudging top managers to reach consensus on how to face the economic crisis together.\n",
      "4. Generative hard work: During times of economic recovery, suppliers can increase PR by leveraging their ability to be technically involved with customers, having compatible top managers, and anticipating customer value altogether. INV is the most influential factor in this scenario.\n",
      "5. Controlled technical deescalating: To reduce CTS during times of recovery, suppliers should carefully deescalate INV without affecting CVA or TMC.\n",
      "6. Integrated optimal balance: During times of recovery, suppliers can integrate efforts on INV, CVA, and TMC to construct synergies and enhance EC. CVA and TMC are recommended as primary mechanisms since they do not have a negative impact on other goals during times of recovery.\n",

They extend previous research streams by showing that a BC brings profitability opportunities for B2B suppliers through nurturing mechanisms from long-term dyadic exchange. Additionally, they contribute to the \"dark side\" of B2B relationships' theoretical underpinnings by demonstrating how the inherent tension created in a BC can be managed through relationship management (RM) mechanisms. Finally, they note that their study contributes to extending BC marketing literature outside of the often-used US environment and provides insights into B2B relationships in emerging markets.\n",
