      " The article discusses the challenges faced by manufacturing companies in choosing appropriate revenue models for their digital services, as they transition from traditional product-based business models to digital servitization. The authors argue that the choice of revenue model is critical in capturing value from digital services and overcoming the \"digitalization paradox,\" where companies struggle to obtain expected financial returns from their digital offerings. They identify three key factors that influence the choice of revenue models: customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. The study contributes to the literature by extending knowledge of digital servitization, exploring factors that influence revenue model choice, and providing an ecosystem perspective on pricing and revenue models.\n",
      "Summary of managerial implications: \n",
      " This section of the article discusses the managerial implications of the study's findings on revenue models for digital services. The authors argue that companies face challenges in selecting appropriate revenue models that align with their digital servitization goals, and that there are three key managerial implications to consider. Firstly, companies need to understand the nature and characteristics of different revenue models (subscription, usage-based, and performance-based) and choose the ones that align with their business models. Secondly, managers must develop a progressive understanding of the factors that influence their choice of revenue model, including customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Finally, manufacturing companies should increase multi-actor participation in digital servitization processes and adopt a flexible approach to revenue model selection, allowing for negotiation with multiple actors and adaptation to changing underlying factors over time.\n",
      "Summary of theoretical implications: \n",
      " The article discusses the choice of revenue models for digital services in manufacturing companies undergoing digital transformation. The authors identify three influencing factors - customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships - and propose a four-step framework to inform the choice of revenue models. They also contribute to the pricing and revenue model literature by providing insights beyond the internal view of companies offering digital services, highlighting the importance of involving ecosystem actors. The study emphasizes the criticality of selecting an appropriate revenue model for digital services, which can be subscription-based, usage-based or performance-based, and how it depends on the payment type, risk level, and contractual orientation.\n",
      "Summary of framework for choosing revenue models in digital services: \n",
      " This article proposes a framework for manufacturing companies to choose revenue models for digital services. The framework includes four steps: assessing customer digital readiness, evaluating digital service sophistication, assessing digital ecosystem partnerships, and choosing a suitable revenue model. The first step involves analyzing the customer's digital awareness, value co-creation, and contractual arrangements. Based on this analysis, companies can choose between subscription, usage-based, or performance-based models. The second step evaluates the digital service's sophistication, including data integration and analytics capabilities. Usage-based and performance-based models are more desirable for more sophisticated digital services. The third step assesses the need for data exchange and security between ecosystem actors. Performance-based models are appropriate when there is significant collaboration among actors. Finally, the fourth step involves selecting a revenue model that meets the needs concerning customers' digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships.\n",
      "Summary of digital ecosystem partnership: \n",
      " The article discusses the importance of digital ecosystem partnerships in delivering digital services. Ecosystem actors such as railway operators, track contractors, infrastructure managers, and IT companies need to collaborate and share data to provide seamless digital services. Data sharing and security are critical factors that enable focal companies to deliver digital services. Sharing data allows ecosystem actors to gather precise data from diverse sources, which is necessary to leverage accurate digital services. However, data sharing requires adequate infrastructure systems to protect sensitive data from vulnerabilities. Moreover, digital ecosystem partnerships are underpinned by co-development with ecosystem partners, which involves working together to provide and develop digital services. Close cooperation with ecosystem partners can lead to the development of advanced digital services, illustrating a higher level of digital ecosystem partnership.\n"
