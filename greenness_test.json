    "extract_insights": " * Insight 1: The article highlights the importance of digital servitization in manufacturing companies and how it can lead to a competitive business strategy. Digital servitization involves making the transition from products to services or a combination of both, where companies need to capture profits from investing in R&D or implementing new technologies. However, only a limited number of studies have explored revenue models holistically, and most empirics have been built on revenue models for data-driven services. Therefore, there is a need for further research to advance understanding of the factors that influence the choice of revenue models for digital services in manufacturing companies.\n* Insight 2: The study reveals that subscription models are the simplest and less risky option to capture value for digital services, where customers can be charged over a recurring period based on transactional contracts. Usage-based revenue models represent a moderate risk because companies can perceive a potential gap in the flow of revenues in an arrangement where payments are settled through pre-negotiated fees in a unit of measure logic (mostly hourly-based metrics). Performance-based revenue models are the most complex and riskiest option as they depend on the actual usage and performance of the digital service.\n* Insight 3: The framework provided in the article offers a four-step approach to choosing revenue models for digital services. The first step assesses the customer's digital readiness, including their awareness, digital value co-creation, and contractual arrangements for digital services. The second step evaluates the sophistication of the digital service, such as basic vs. advanced services. The third step assesses digital ecosystem partnerships, which involve data exchange and collaboration between actors. Finally, the fourth step involves selecting the suitable revenue model based on the previous assessments. This framework can guide managers in making informed decisions about revenue models that align with their digital servitization goals.\n* Insight 4: Digital ecosystem partnerships play a crucial role in delivering digital services, requiring significant intervention by ecosystem actors. Companies need to engage with ecosystem actors to provide and develop digital services, ensuring that data sharing is secure and protected through security standards and interoperable protocols.

The study found that donors prefer campaigns with a clear purpose, such as supporting hospitals or buying health materials, and that they are more likely to donate to campaigns that seem reliable, with organizers who assume responsibility for the money collected.\n* Insight 2: The paper also explores how different government policy restrictions influenced campaign outcomes in terms of amount raised and number of campaigns promoted in six European countries. The findings suggest that governments can encourage donations via fiscal incentives and policy restrictions, and that maintaining transparency and accountability in the use of funds is crucial for building trust among donors.\n* Insight 3: The study uses data from donation crowdfunding campaigns set up by celebrities, such as Chiara Ferragni and her husband, singer Fedez, who raised almost \u20ac4.5 million from over 206,000 donors in a few days to create an additional coronavirus intensive care unit in an Italian hospital. This highlights the potential for influential individuals to make a significant impact through charitable initiatives.\n* Insight 4: The research finds that donors are interested in campaigns that support hospitals in more fragile health systems or buy health materials, suggesting that there is a strong desire among donors to contribute to efforts that address pressing public health needs. Organizations seeking donations should emphasize the specific ways in which their campaigns will improve healthcare infrastructure and outcomes.\n* Insight 5: The paper notes that donations were huge during COVID-19, but donors rarely received financial reports on how funds were used by the beneficiary. This underscores the importance of providing regular updates and transparent reporting to donors, not only to ensure accountability but also to build trust and encourage continued support.\n* Insight 6: The study's focus on donor preferences and government policies provides valuable insights for policymakers and nonprofit organizations seeking to mobilize resources during rare events like natural disasters or pandemics.

These mechanisms can help suppliers leverage their B2B relationships and achieve better performance outcomes.\n* Insight 3: The findings of the study suggest that large size, market leader suppliers can effectively survive and thrive through a BC via distinct RM mechanisms. This indicates that larger, more established suppliers may have an advantage in maintaining successful B2B relationships during economic uncertainty.\n* Insight 4: The study demonstrates that managing B2B relationships during a BC requires a different approach than managing relationships during times of economic expansion.

This framework should consider the dynamic nature of buyer\u2013seller relationships and extend beyond the traditional normative guidelines for managing industrial businesses.\n* Insight 3: The findings suggest that suppliers should focus on nurturing a system of mechanisms from long-term dyadic exchange, building over communication \u2192 interaction \u2192 value RM process. Investments in relationships need to consider forward-looking measures such as customer lifetime value.\n* Insight 4: The research demonstrates that large size, market leader suppliers can effectively survive and thrive through a BC via distinct RM mechanisms. Study 1 identifies key mechanisms of RM process (communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation) and performance outcomes (price, cost-to-serve, and expectation of relationship continuity) from the supplier\u2019s view.\n* Insight 5: Study 2 conducts a multi-group analysis, testing the model in times of recovery/expansion. The findings offer directions for suppliers on how to leverage B2B relationships through a BC. Particularly, the authors indicate that supplier\u2019s performance is influenced differently by RM mechanisms during times of economic crisis versus times of recovery/expansion.\n* Insight 6: The article extends the BC marketing literature outside the often-used U.S. environment, providing insights into B2B relationships in emerging economies. It also contributes to the dark side of B2B relationships\u2019 theoretical underpinnings by showing that the inherent tension created in a BC can be managed by RM mechanisms.",
