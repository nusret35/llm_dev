    "extract_insights": " * Insight 1: The article highlights the importance of digital servitization in manufacturing companies and how it can lead to a competitive business strategy. Digital servitization involves making the transition from products to services or a combination of both, where companies need to capture profits from investing in R&D or implementing new technologies. However, only a limited number of studies have explored revenue models holistically, and most empirics have been built on revenue models for data-driven services. Therefore, there is a need for further research to advance understanding of the factors that influence the choice of revenue models for digital services in manufacturing companies.\n* Insight 2: The study reveals that subscription models are the simplest and less risky option to capture value for digital services, where customers can be charged over a recurring period based on transactional contracts. Usage-based revenue models represent a moderate risk because companies can perceive a potential gap in the flow of revenues in an arrangement where payments are settled through pre-negotiated fees in a unit of measure logic (mostly hourly-based metrics). Performance-based revenue models are the most complex and riskiest option as they depend on the actual usage and performance of the digital service.\n* Insight 3: The framework provided in the article offers a four-step approach to choosing revenue models for digital services. The first step assesses the customer's digital readiness, including their awareness, digital value co-creation, and contractual arrangements for digital services. The second step evaluates the sophistication of the digital service, such as basic vs. advanced services. The third step assesses digital ecosystem partnerships, which involve data exchange and collaboration between actors. Finally, the fourth step involves selecting the suitable revenue model based on the previous assessments. This framework can guide managers in making informed decisions about revenue models that align with their digital servitization goals.\n* Insight 4: Digital ecosystem partnerships play a crucial role in delivering digital services, requiring significant intervention by ecosystem actors. Companies need to engage with ecosystem actors to provide and develop digital services, ensuring that data sharing is secure and protected through security standards and interoperable protocols.

The study found that donors prefer campaigns with a clear purpose, such as supporting hospitals or buying health materials, and that they are more likely to donate to campaigns that seem reliable, with organizers who assume responsibility for the money collected.\n* Insight 2: The paper also explores how different government policy restrictions influenced campaign outcomes in terms of amount raised and number of campaigns promoted in six European countries. The findings suggest that governments can encourage donations via fiscal incentives and policy restrictions, and that maintaining transparency and accountability in the use of funds is crucial for building trust among donors.\n* Insight 3: The study uses data from donation crowdfunding campaigns set up by celebrities, such as Chiara Ferragni and her husband, singer Fedez, who raised almost \u20ac4.5 million from over 206,000 donors in a few days to create an additional coronavirus intensive care unit in an Italian hospital. This highlights the potential for influential individuals to make a significant impact through charitable initiatives.\n* Insight 4: The research finds that donors are interested in campaigns that support hospitals in more fragile health systems or buy health materials, suggesting that there is a strong desire among donors to contribute to efforts that address pressing public health needs. Organizations seeking donations should emphasize the specific ways in which their campaigns will improve healthcare infrastructure and outcomes.\n* Insight 5: The paper notes that donations were huge during COVID-19, but donors rarely received financial reports on how funds were used by the beneficiary. This underscores the importance of providing regular updates and transparent reporting to donors, not only to ensure accountability but also to build trust and encourage continued support.\n* Insight 6: The study's focus on donor preferences and government policies provides valuable insights for policymakers and nonprofit organizations seeking to mobilize resources during rare events like natural disasters or pandemics.

Companies need to select an appropriate revenue model that aligns with their digital servitization goals. There are three types of revenue models: subscription-based, usage-based, and performance-based. Companies must assess their customers' digital readiness, evaluate the sophistication of their digital services, and consider digital ecosystem partnerships before selecting a suitable revenue model.\n* Insight 2: The significance of understanding customer digital readiness. Companies should identify their customers' level of digitization to determine the type of digital service that meets their expectations and demands. Customers can be either digitally immature or knowledgeable, and companies must tailor their revenue models accordingly. Digitally mature customers are open to long-term, flexible contractual agreements, while digitally immature customers require basic, simple solutions.\n* Insight 3: The role of digital service sophistication in revenue model selection. Digital service sophistication is associated with data integration, which enhances customers' business intelligence. Companies must evaluate the level of sophistication required for their digital services, as this will impact their choice of revenue model. More advanced digital services require more complex revenue models, such as performance-based models.\n* Insight 4: The importance of digital ecosystem partnerships. Companies need to collaborate with ecosystem actors to provide and develop digital services. Liberal data sharing permits collaboration among ecosystem actors, allowing them to gather precise data from diverse sources. This enables the provision of accurate digital services, such as life cycle management software, which requires permission for data access but needs limited collaboration between interfaces.\n* Insight 5: The need for a viable diagnosis of customers' digital readiness, digital service sophistication, and digital ecosystem partnerships. Companies face challenges in capturing the elements that are essential in assessing these three steps, as they are frequently interlinked. A common challenge is the reluctance of ecosystem actors to share data, which can compromise data security. To overcome this challenge, companies must work closely with ecosystem partners to co-develop digital services.",

The findings suggest that the impact of RM mechanisms on performance outcomes differs between times of economic crisis and recovery/expansion.\n4. The research focuses on emerging economies, where interorganizational relationships play a critical role in business organizations, particularly in industries with cyclical behavior like commodities.\n5. The study contributes to the RM literature and BC literature by exploring the role of RM process in determining the specific contribution of long-life customers during periods of contraction and expansion.\n6. Interorganizational learning theories and RM theory provide insights into relationship tenets that help suppliers sustain or increase performance from their B2B long-life customers during economic swings.\n7. Companies need to manage communication openness, technical involvement, and customer value anticipation simultaneously to optimize customer level outcomes (selling price, cost-to-serve, and expectation of continuity).\n8. The research highlights the importance of dyadic top management consensus and technical involvement in increasing selling price during times of economic recovery.\n9. To reduce cost-to-serve during recovery, suppliers should carefully deescalate technical collaboration with customers, while customer value anticipation and top management compatibility have no influence on this goal.\n10. Marketing literature lacks normative guidelines for managing an industrial business through a BC. This study addresses this gap by identifying and testing a model for price, cost-to-serve, and expectation of continuity variations during a BC in an emerging economy.\n11.
