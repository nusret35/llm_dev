The quiz will cover all the material up to and including Recitation 13 (CDNs). The quiz will be \u0026ldquo;open book.\u0026rdquo; That means you can bring along any printed or written materials that you think might be useful. Calculators are allowed, though typically not necessary. You may also bring a laptop to view, e.g., PDF versions of papers and notes, but you may not connect to any network; make sure you download the papers to your laptop before the quiz. Charge your laptops before you come; we cannot guarantee outlet availability.\nTutorial 8: Design Project Presentation Your presentation should reflect the feedback you got on your preliminary report; feedback on your presentation should inform your final report. Your presentation will focus on any changes you have made since the preliminary report, rather than re-capping the entire system. See the Design Project section for more information.\nDesign Project Pressentation (DPP) Assigned: Design Project Presentation (PDF), Design Project Presentation Evaluation Ideas (PDF) "}
