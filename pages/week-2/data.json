UNIX Assignment Part 1 Hands-on Assignment 2: UNIX (Not available to OCW users.)\nTutorial 2: Consensus and Critique One of the goals of 6.033 is for students to be able to analyze and critique technical systems. We will assign multiple system critiques during the semester.\nThese critiques will be graded by your TAs and/or Communication Instructors, and assigned a letter grade (we will specify more details about grading in each of the assignments). The expectations for each individual critique will be detailed in the tutorials. As your skills at analyzing and reading technical papers improve throughout the semester, we will expect your critiques to reflect that.\n"}
