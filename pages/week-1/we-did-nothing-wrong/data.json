  "content":"Read \u0026ldquo;We Did Nothing Wrong: Why Software Quality Matters\u0026rdquo; by Deborah Gage and John McCormick in Baseline Magazine on March 4, 2004. This paper details a number of software systems that failed in spectacular ways, with most of the focus on a radiation machine made by Multidata called the Cobalt-60.\nAs you read, think about the following:\nWhat fault(s) contributed to the failure of the Multidata machine? Are there quality-control procedures that might have made a difference? Question for Recitation Before you come to this recitation, write up (on paper) a brief answer to the following (reallyâ€”we don\u0026rsquo;t need more than a sentence or so for each question):\nWhat was the Cobalt-60? How did it fail? Why did it fail? (There are multiple possible answers to each of these questions.)\n"}
