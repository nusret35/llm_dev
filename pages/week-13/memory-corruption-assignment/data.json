  "content":"For this recitation, you\u0026rsquo;ll be reading \u0026ldquo;SoK: Eternal War in Memory (PDF)\u0026rdquo; by Lazlo Szekeres, Mathia Payer, Tao Wei, and Dawn Song. This paper describes a variety of memory corruption bugs, and potential solutions. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about memorizing every single type of attack described in this paper; aim to understand what makes these attacks possible, and the general ideas behind the solutions.\n(We\u0026rsquo;ve also written a quick guide (PDF) to some of the memory corruption bugs described in the paper, which you might want to take a look at before you start reading.)\nThe paper is fairly well organized:\nSection I gives you an introduction to the general problem, and a brief history of memory corruption attacks and defenses. Section II details many different types of memory corruption attacks. Figure 1 is particularly helpful in organizing these attacks and their defenses. As stated above, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about memorizing every single type of attack described in this section; aim to understand what makes the various attacks different from one another, as well as what makes each of these possible in the first place. Section III describes two currently-deployed defenses, and their drawbacks. Section IV outlines some properties and requirements for defenses against memory corruption bugs; those defenses are discussed in Sections V-VIII (each section is a different category of defense). Sections IX and X conclude. As you read, think about the following:\nStack canaries (or cookies) and ASLR are both widely-deployed. What is good about those solutions? What attacks do they prevent? What attacks don\u0026rsquo;t they prevent? Many of the proposed solutions worsen performance. Are we at a point where these performance hits are outweighed by security concerns? Questions for Recitation Before you come to this recitation, write up (on paper) a brief answer to the following (really—we don\u0026rsquo;t need more than a couple sentences for each question). Your answers to these questions should be in your own words, not direct quotations from the paper.\nWhat do the authors mean by \u0026ldquo;the eternal war in memory\u0026rdquo;? How has this war progressed over time? (i.e., how have attacks and solutions evolved) Why hasn\u0026rsquo;t the war ended? As always, there are multiple correct answers for each of these questions.\n"}
