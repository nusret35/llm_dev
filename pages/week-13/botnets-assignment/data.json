  "content":"Read \u0026ldquo;Your Botnet is My Botnet: Analysis of a Botnet Takeover (PDF)\u0026rdquo; by Stone-Gross, et al. You can skim sections 5.2.1–5.2.3.\nSection 2 explains how Torpig infects a user\u0026rsquo;s machine. After reading this section, you should understand how that happens: how the rootkit gets installed and why its installation remains undetected. Section 3 explains the technique (domain flux) by which Torpig bots communicate with the C\u0026amp;C (command and control) server. After reading this section, you should understand why it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to simply block bots from accessing the C\u0026amp;C server. Section 4 explains how the authors were able to take control of the Torpig botnet for a few weeks. Sections 5 and 6 give an analysis of the botnet based on the authors\u0026rsquo; takeover. (Remember you can skim sections 5.2.1–5.2.3) As you read, think about\nWhat tools and/or threat models are violated by Torpig? Think about the key factors that allowed the authors to infiltrate the Torpig botnet. Would their techniques work for all botnets? Was the authors\u0026rsquo; methodology—taking over the botnet—necessary to collect the data they wanted? Was it ethical? Questions for Recitation Before you come to this recitation, write up (on paper) a brief answer to the following (really—we don\u0026rsquo;t need more than a couple sentences for each question). Your answers to these questions should be in your own words, not direct quotations from the paper.\nWhat does it mean for a computer to be a \u0026ldquo;bot\u0026rdquo;? In Torpig, how does a machine become a bot, and how does it receive instructions to carry out attacks? Why is it difficult to prevent a machine from becoming a bot? Why is it difficult to simply block bots from accessing the C\u0026amp;C server? As always, there are multiple answers to each of these questions.\n"}
