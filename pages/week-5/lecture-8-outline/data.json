  "content":" Welcome to Networking How networks work is a big part of systems. Network = source of failure for many systems. Why? Today: Intro to network / history of Internet. Look for common themes that you\u0026rsquo;ll see over and over. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about details of specific protocols today; we\u0026rsquo;ll delve into those later on. General Networks Model networks as graphs. Endpoints on outskirts, switches (a type of \u0026ldquo;middlebox\u0026rdquo;) in the middle. Edge = direct connection between two nodes (perhaps a wire, perhaps not). Problems: Addressing Naming Routing Transport For small networks: Naming/addressing: Just assign each node a unique name. Routing: How do nodes figure out how to get data to other nodes? Transport: Lots of questions here. One problem to think about is reliability: What do we do when a packet gets dropped? In 6.033, we care mostly about the Internet. The Internet is not a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; network. The Internet, Pre-1993 Launch of Sputnik =\u0026gt; creation of ARPA (now DARPA).\n1970S: ARPAnet. Started small. Combined addressing and transport. Began to grow by connecting existing networks.\nUsing hosts.txt, distance-vector, sliding-window, etc. 1978: Decide to make the Internet flexible. Encourages a layered model. Typical model:\n7 [ Application ] - super high level\n5/6 [ Session/Presentation ]\n4 [ Transport ] - reliable (maybe) delivery\n3 [ Network - IP ] - addressing/routing\n2 [ Link ] - point-to-point links\n1 [ Physical ] - physical medium\nOften in 6.033 we care about the Application, Transport, Network, and link layers.\nIdeally, layering lets us swap out protocols.\n~1983: TCP, provides reliable transport. Now apps don\u0026rsquo;t have to reimplement reliable delivery.\nGrowth =\u0026gt; Change 1978-79: Link-state routing, EGP. More scalable routing. 1982: DNS. More scalable naming. Also enabled growth through distributed management. Growth =\u0026gt; Problems Mid 80s: Congestion collapse. So many packets in network, but none were useful. TCP added a congestion control mechanism (more on this next week). Why add it to TCP, not as a separate layer? It was already hard to add a new layer, even in the 80s. Early 90s: Policy routing. Internet was beginning to be commercialized, parts of it didn\u0026rsquo;t want to provide transit to commercial transit. Policy routing (BGP) is a means to do this. Notice: Commercialization is causing problems. Addressing. Assign addresses in chunks of different sizes. \u0026ldquo;Class B\u0026rdquo; chunks — 65K — are typically \u0026ldquo;just right\u0026rdquo;, and we ran out of those. The protocol CIDR was developed to divide these up. Most interesting thing about CIDR: That it was possible to make this change at all. Changing addressing =\u0026gt; changing switches. Happened because all switches were made by Cisco and forwarding was done in software. The Internet, Post-1993 1993: Commercialization. Changes stopped. \u0026ldquo;New technologies essentially get deployed for reasons of fear or greed (PDF).\u0026rdquo; Problems We Deal with Today DDoS: Send a lot of traffic to one machine to consume its resources. Hard to prevent. Internet wasn\u0026rsquo;t designed with accountability in mind. Security: Internet was not designed for security. DNS, BGP, etc., have no secure infrastructure. Mobility: No one every imagined this. Address Space Depletion: IPv4 -\u0026gt; IPv6. Congestion control: Should probably change given the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the Internet (more about this later). So What\u0026rsquo;s New on the Internet? Lots. P2P, wireless, mobile, streaming, cloud computing, datacenter networks, security threats/defenses\u0026hellip; Almost everything happens on the Internet today! Crazy. We expect to see continued changes: Massive growth, software-defined networks, sensors, robots, embedded devices, privacy, censorship. Recurring Themes Layering and hierarchy (particularly hierarchy as a means of addressing scale). Scalability: If enforcing modularity was the theme of the first part of 6.033, scalability is the theme of the second part. Performance/efficiency: As the Internet grew, performance requirements informed its (re-)design. Diversity of Applications: As the Internet grew, more and more applications used it. These applications have different demands: Some care about throughput, some care about latency, some care about both, some need reliability, some don\u0026rsquo;t, etc. We have to build a network that works for all of them. Money: Because people pay to use the Internet, designing protocols can sometimes be trickier than it \u0026ldquo;should\u0026rdquo; be. End-to-end argument: What part of the network should implement what features (endpoints, switches, etc.)? "}
