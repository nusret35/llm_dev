The first critique required you to understand and assess a distributed system based on an analytical framework presented in the critique worksheet. In this critique, you\u0026rsquo;ll use your answers to a similar worksheet to write a 2–3 page critique of the system. The third critique will take the form of a peer review of another team\u0026rsquo;s Design Project Report. You\u0026rsquo;ll receive instruction about each of these critiques as the semester progresses.\nSystem Critique Assignment 2: MapReduce Assigned: Critique Assignment 2 "}
