The quiz will cover all the material starting from Lecture 14 up to and including Recitation 25 (Meltdown). We will not explicitly test you on any material from the last lecture and recitation (L26, R26). Note, though, that much of the content during those sessions will tie together concepts from the rest of the class, which will be useful on Quiz 2.\nThe quiz will be \u0026ldquo;open book.\u0026rdquo; That means you can bring along any printed or written materials that you think might be useful. Calculators are allowed, though typically not necessary. You may also bring a laptop to view, e.g., PDF versions of papers and notes, but you may not connect to any network; make sure you download the papers to your laptop before the quiz. Charge your laptops before you come; we cannot guarantee outlet availability.\n"}
