This course is an introductory survey of classic films. 

Emphasis falls equally on cultural and on artistic matters: on films as anthropological and historical artifacts that articulate the values and assumptions of specific societies and eras and on films as works of art. 

The course aims to sharpen studentsâ€™ analytic skills, to give them a sense of the history and cultural significance of movies, and to improve their writing.
