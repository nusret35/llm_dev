The students will be able to evaluate and critique existing systems, as well as their own system designs. As part of that, students will learn to recognize design choices made in existing systems.

The students will be able to apply the technical material taught in lecture to new system components. This implies an ability to recognize and describe how common design patterns in computer system—such as abstraction and modularity—are used to limit complexity.

The students will be able to apply the technical material taught in lecture to new system components. This implies an ability to recognize and describe how operating systems use virtualization and abstraction to enforce modularity.

The students will be able to apply the technical material taught in lecture to new system components. This implies an ability to recognize and describe how the Internet is designed to deal with scale, a diversity of applications, and competing economic interests.

The students will be able to apply the technical material taught in lecture to new system components. This implies an ability to recognize and describe how reliable, usable distributed systems are able to be built on top of an unreliable network.

The students will be able to apply the technical material taught in lecture to new system components. This implies an ability to recognize and describe common pitfalls in the security of computer systems, and how to combat them.
