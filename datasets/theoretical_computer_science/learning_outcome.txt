The students will be able to learn a collection of powerful (and interrelated) mathematical techniques for algorithm design topics picked to be both mathematically interesting and practically useful

The students will be able to learn a collection of powerful (and interrelated) mathematical techniques for algorithm designWill sometimes have long mathematical interludes, but always with proportional algorithmic payoffs

The students will be able to apply these tools directly to your research whether your work is theoretical or applied
