An important element in a competitive business strategy currently
pursued by manufacturing companies is the introduction of digital servitization,
which involves making the transition from products to services,
or a combination of both (Chirumalla, Leoni, & Oghazi, 2023).
Although this transition can attract new customers, increase efficiency,
and create additional revenues (Classen & Friedli, 2021), companies
often struggle to obtain the expected financial returns from their digital
offerings (Kamalaldin, Linde, Sj¨ odin, & Parida, 2020; Korkeam¨ aki,
Sj¨ odin, Kohtam¨ aki, & Parida, 2022). This phenomenon, referred to as
the digitalization paradox, occurs when companies are unable to capture
profits from investing in R&D or implementing new technologies
(Gebauer, Fleisch, et al., 2020; Kohtam¨ aki, Parida, Patel, & Gebauer,
2020).
The way a company captures value from digital services is determined
by its revenue model (Huikkola & Kohtam¨ aki, 2018); a construct
that describes how companies monetize the sales of their products and
services (Casadesus-Masanell & Zhu, 2011). Revenue models and business
models are not synonymous. While business models determine the
structure under which organizations create, deliver, and capture value
(Teece, 2010), the revenue model relates to the value-capture dimension
of the overall architecture of a company’s business model (Zott & Amit,
2010). It exclusively alludes to the financial viability of the company
(Sj¨ odin, Parida, & Visnjic, 2022), or “the revenue formula” through
which customers are charged (Huikkola & Kohtam¨ aki, 2018). Misaligned
revenue models hamper profit generation (Gebauer, Fleisch,
et al., 2020). Thus, the inadequate choice of a revenue model becomes
an obstacle to the optimal positioning of digital services (Angeren,
Vroom, McCann, Podoynitsyna, & Langerak, 2022). It means that the
choice of a revenue model requires companies to reshape the traditional
strategy of selling standalone products and adopt a logic that permits
them to move toward product–service–software offerings (Kohtam¨ aki,
Rabetino, Einola, Parida, & Patel, 2021).
Among the business model elements, the value-capture dimension –
and, specifically, the revenue model – is the one that has received least
attention (Chen, Visnjic, Parida, & Zhang, 2021). Only a limited number
of studies have explored revenue models holistically (Classen & Friedli,
2021; Remeˇ
nov´
a, Kintler, & Jankelov´
a, 2020), whereas most of the
empirics have been built on revenue models for data-driven services (Enders, Schüritz, & Frey, 2019; S´
a, Carvalho, Silva, & Rezazadeh, 2022;
Schüritz, Seebacher, & Dorner, 2017). Indeed, the dominant literature
has been based on insights retrieved from consumer markets and information
goods (e.g., apps, mobile products, and online platforms)
(Angeren et al., 2022; Numminen, S¨ allberg, & Wang, 2022; Roma &
Ragaglia, 2016). Limited research has contributed to an understanding
of revenue models for digital services (Linde, Frishammar, & Parida,
2023; Tidhar & Eisenhardt, 2020). In addition, knowledge of the factors
that influence that choice remains largely uncharted territory. This gap
is even more evident when witnessing the scarcity of research on the
revenue models for manufacturing companies undergoing digital servitization
transformation (Chen et al., 2021; Linde et al., 2023).
Therefore, the overarching purpose of this research is to advance understanding
of the factors that influence the choice of revenue models for
digital services in manufacturing companies.
To address this gap, we built our observations from two global
manufacturing companies in the railway industry that are gradually
moving toward digital servitization. The railway industry is a suitable
sector to explore the challenges that manufacturing companies face in
choosing revenue models for their digital services (Jablo´ nski &
Jablo´ nski, 2020). This is because the railway industry is experiencing
slower levels of digitalization compared to the pace of the overall
transportation industry (Jablo´ nski & Jablo´ nski, 2019). Such concerns
have been highlighted as part of the role of the business model in the
implementation of digital services (Kans & Ingwald, 2021), particularly
in the value-capture dimensions of the business model (Tabares & Parida,
2022).
Our contributions to the literature are threefold. Firstly, we extend
our knowledge of digital servitization by providing a rich perspective on
revenue models and the value-capture dimension of business models for
the digital services offering. Secondly, we provide insights to overcome
the digitalization paradox by exploring the factors that influence the
choice of revenue models. We show that manufacturing companies take
into consideration three factors in choosing revenue models for digital
services – namely, customer digital readiness, digital service sophistication,
and digital ecosystem partnerships. Thirdly, we extend the
pricing and revenue model literature by moving beyond traditional
approaches focused on an internal view of the company and offering an
ecosystem perspective – a perspective that has recently been receiving
consideration in the literature.
In this paper, we start by providing a theoretical background on
digital servitization in manufacturing companies and revenue models
for digital services, including a review of existing research on revenue
models for digital services. This is followed by addressing the methodology
and describing the data collection and data analysis processes. We
continue with the findings, structured according to the revenue models
utilized by manufacturing companies and the factors that influence that
choice in offering digital services. We conclude with a discussion of the
study’s limitations and a consideration of avenues for future studies.

digital services. Due to the transitioning process that manufacturing
companies face when moving from selling stand-alone products to
advanced product–service–software offerings (Huikkola et al., 2022;
Kohtam¨ aki et al., 2021), a deeper understanding of how to make positive
profit gains from this transition needs to be developed. Our theoretical
contributions relate principally to the emerging literature on digital
servitization with a specific focus on revenue models.
As a first theoretical contribution, the present study extends our
knowledge of the digital servitization literature by offering an in-depth
perspective on the value-capturing dimension of digital services. The results
of this study demonstrate that manufacturing companies can choose
between various options for revenue models. Therefore, we contend that
there is not a single or unique choice of revenue model. Centrally, our
finding reveals that being able to select an appropriate revenue model
for digital services is of critical importance. Thus, we augment the
literature on revenue models for digital services by showing that each
model contains characteristics that have been overlooked in previous
studies (Gebauer, Arzt, et al., 2020; Linde et al., 2023). Revenue model
characteristics relate to the payment type (e.g., payment frequency), risk
level (e.g., from risk free to risk sharing), and contractual orientation (e.
g., transactional vs. long-term approaches). This study reveals that the
subscription model is the simplest and less risky option to capture value
for digital services, where customers can be charged over a recurring
period based on transactional contracts. Usage-based revenue models
represent a moderate risk because companies can perceive a potential
gap in the flow of revenues in an arrangement where payments are
settled through pre-negotiated fees in a unit of measure logic (mostly
hourly-based metrics). Performance models are seen as the most complex
because they require acute interactions with customers and
ecosystem partners, holding more risk and, at the same time, greater
value-adding potential in the digital servitization pathway.
Second, we contribute to the digital servitization literature by identifying
and describing influencing factors that mitigate the “digitalization paradox”
for manufacturing companies offering a wide range of digital services. These
factors are vital to understand because they influence the choice of
revenue model. In this regard, our study identifies and conceptualizes
three influencing factors – namely: a) customer digital readiness, which
refers to the customer’s digital service awareness, the customer’s willingness
to co-create digital value, and the customer’s contractual
arrangement propensity for digital services; b) digital service sophistication,
which relates to the orientation of digital services and data
integration and analytics; and, c) digital ecosystem partnerships, which
refer to the processes of data sharing and security, and digital service co-
development with ecosystem partners. By proposing a four-step framework
that informs the choice of revenue models for digital services
(Fig. 2), we extend previous research that contends that a relational view
of digital servitization is crucial (Kamalaldin et al., 2020). Specifically,
we elucidate how a deeper exploration of the customer–provider relationship
is the starting point to strategically address and overcome the
digital servitization paradox and remain profitable (Gebauer, Fleisch,
et al., 2020).
Third, we contribute to the pricing and revenue model literature by
providing insights that go beyond the internal view of companies offering
digital services. Although the pricing literature has been the core of
revenue-model discussion in digital servitization, our research provides
a more comprehensive view, taking into account the relevance of
involving ecosystem actors – a perspective that is currently being
addressed in the literature (Bencsik et al., 2023). This study focuses
further attention on the ecosystem dimension of digital servitization
(Huikkola, Kohtam¨ aki, & Ylim¨ aki, 2022; Kohtam¨ aki, Parida, Oghazi,
Gebauer, & Baines, 2019, 2021, 2022), an analysis traditionally relegated
to the relationship between the company and the customer (Linde
et al., 2023). This is particularly relevant in the case of performance-
based revenue models, where the digital ecosystem partnership is critical
in choosing this type of model. As noted in our study, to provide
advanced product–service–software offerings, the ecosystem in which a
digital service is embedded requires a high flow of data sharing and the
construction of data security interfaces. As more actors are engaged in
this flowing exchange, ecosystem partners are expected to carry out
digital services through co-development practices that adopt a more
collective stance and have greater complexity. By deepening the
ecosystem dimensions, our findings reveal a much more holistic view of
revenue models than previous studies.
