2 The Polar of a Polytop e 
Given a bounded polytop e C ⊂ Rn that contains the origin in its interior, we can represe nt C as 
C = {x|x ≤ bi,i =1,...,k}, ai · 
where bi > 0. 
Without loss of generalit y, by appropriately scaling each constrain t, we can assume bi =1, ∀i =1,...,k. 
Now the polar of C is given by 
C∗ = conv(a1,...,ak). 
2.1 Examples 
Let C be the square with corners at (1, 1), (1, −1), (−1, 1), (−1, −1). Then {ai} = {(1, 0), (0, 1), (−1, 0), (0, −1)}. 
The polar has corners at (1, 0), (0, 1), (−1, 0), (0, −1). Note that the polar is a square rotated and shrunk 
into a diamond. This polytop e is also referred to as the ”cross polytop e”. Note that the facets of C become 
the vertices of C∗ and vice versa. For example, the three dimensional cube’s polar is the octahedron. Six 
facets and eight vertice s corresp ond to eight facets and six vertices. 
The size and shape of a polar tends to be the reverse of that of the original set. For example, a short 
bulging rectangle with corners at (100, 3), (100, −3), (−100, 3), (−100, −3) would have a tall compressed polar 
with corners at (±1/100, 0), (0, ±1/3). Also note that polars of simplices are simplices. 
2.2 Prop erties of a polar 
Some of the useful properties of a polar is summarised here. The properties will be illustrated using pictures . 
(C∗)∗ = C (proof later). • 
If C is origin-symmetric, then so is C∗. •
If A ⊆ B then B∗ ⊆ A∗.
 • 
If A is scaled up, then A∗ is scaled down. • 
If the polar is low-dimensional, that would mean the original polytop e had to be unbounded in some • 
directions. 
11-1 •	Translation has a very drastic eﬀect on the polar. It can become unbounded just by translating the 
polytop e. 
All these properties can be illustrated using the pictures below. 
3 Polars of General Convex Bodies 
Any convex body can be though t of as the intersection of a (possibly inﬁnite) set of half spaces. These are 
called ”‘sup orting hyperplanes”’. Therefore, the polar of a convex body can be seen as the convex hull of a 
(possibly inﬁnite) set of points, coming from all of the supp orting hyperplanes. With this intuition one can 
guess about the following : 
•	Polar of a sphere is a sphere. 
•	Polar of a sphere of radius r is a sphere of radius 1/r. 
•	Polar of an ellipse is an ellipse with axes reversed. 
Deﬁnition 1 The polar of a convex body C is given by 
C∗ = {x ∈ Rn|x · c ≤ 1∀c ∈ C} 
We observ e that this deﬁnition is equiv alent to the previous deﬁnition . 
Prop osition 2 For a polytop e C given by C = {x|ai · x ≤ bi,i =1,...,k}, the sets C1 = C2 wher e 
C1 = {x ∈ Rn|x · c ≤ 1∀c ∈ C} and C2 == conv(a1,...,ak). 
We skip the proof as it is easy to verify that if x ∈ C1 then x ∈ C2 and vice versa. 
We will now prove that (C∗)∗ = C. We would be needing the concept of a separating hyperplane for the 
proof which we introduce now. 
3.1 Separating Hyperplanes 
Given a convex body K ⊆ Rn and a point p,a separating hyperplane for K and p is a hyperplan e that has 
K on one side of it and p on the other. More forma lly, for a vector ν, the hyperplane H = {x|ν · x =1} is a 
separating hyperplane for K and p if 
1.	νx ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K, and · 
2.	νp ≥ 1.· 
Note that if we replace the right hand side of both the above conditions by 0 or any other constan t, we 
get an equiv alent formulation. 
We call a separating hyperplane H a strongly separating hyperplane if the second inequalit y is strict. 
Theorem 3 Separating Hyperplane Theorem : If K is a convex body and p is a point not containe d in 
K, then there exists a hyperplane that strongly separates them. 
Proof We’ll sketch an outline of the proof. It can be made rigorous. Consider a point x ∈ K that is 
the closest to p in �2 distance. Consider the plane H that is perpendicular to the line joining x to p and is 
passing through the midp oint of x and p. H must separate K from p because if there is some point of K, 
say y, that is on the same side of H as p, then we can use the convexity of K to conclude that the point 
x� which is the intersection of the hyperplane with the line joining x and y is also in K. x� is closer to p 
that x since px� forms the side of a right angled triangle of which xp is the hypotenuse. This contradicts the 
assumption that x is the point closest to p. 
11-2 3.2 Polar of a Polar 
We’ll use the above result to show why the polar of the polar of a convex body is the body itself. Recall 
that for a convex body K, we had deﬁned its polar K∗ to be {p|kp ≤ 1∀k ∈ K}.· 
Theorem 4 Let K be a convex body. Then K∗∗ = K. 
Proof We know that K∗ = {p|k · p ≤ 1∀k ∈ K}. Similarly K∗∗ = {y|p · y ≤ 1∀p ∈ k∗}. Let y be any 
point in K. Then, by the deﬁnition of the polar, for all p ∈ K∗ we have that py ≤ 1. The deﬁnition of the · 
polar of K∗ implies that y ∈ k∗∗. Since this is true for every y ∈ K, we conclude that K ⊆ K∗∗. 
The other direction of the proof is the nontrivial one and we’ll have to use the convexity of the body and 
the separating hyperplane theorem. If possible, let y be such that y ∈ K∗∗ and y �∈ K. Since y ∈ K∗∗, we 
have that Py ≤ 1∀p ∈ K∗. Since y �∈ K, there exists a strongly separating hyperplane for y and K. Let it · 
be H = {x|v · x =1}. By the deﬁnition of separating hyperplane, we have v · k ≤ 1∀k ∈ K. Hence, v ∈ K∗. 
Also, v y> 1 (since H is a separating hyperplane), and we just showed that v ∈ K∗. This contradicts our · 
assumption that y ∈ K∗∗. Hence K∗∗ ⊆ K. 
4 Norms and Symmetric Convex Bodies 
We will show how norms and symmetric convex bodies co-exist. This provides us a way to use the results 
of Convex Geometry in Functional Analysis and vice versa. Recall that a norm on Rn is a map q : Rn R→
such that: 
1. q(ax) = aq(x) for a ∈ R (homogeneit y) 
2. q(x + y) ≤ q(x)+ q(y) (triangle inequalit y) 
3. q(x) ≥ 0 for all x (nonnegativit y) (actually implied by 1 and 2) 
4. q(x)=0 if and only if x = 0 (positivit y) (without this conditions, q is a ”seminorm”) 
Note that given a norm, one can construct a convex body. The simplest being the unit ball Bq = {x ∈
Rn|q(x) ≤ 1}. It is an easy exercise to verify the convexity of Bq. 
Also as we will show now, given a convex body C, we can come up with a norm under which C is the 
unit ball. Note that C has to be origin symmetric. 
Deﬁnition 5 The Minkow ski functional of an origin symmetric convex body C is the map pC : Rn R 
deﬁne d by → 
pC (x) = inf 
λ>0{x ∈ λC} 
(We will sometimes denote this by ||x||C , because it is a norm.) 
To prove that this is a norm, one needs to verify the properties of homogeneit y, triangle inequalit y etc. These 
follow from the convexity of the body. 
4.1 Norms, Duals, and the Polar 
For any norm q, we can deﬁne its dual by q∗(x) = supv=0�| qv
(·
vx 
) |. It is an exercise to see that the unit ball 
with respect to the dual norm of q is the polar of the unit ball with respect to q. This provides us a direct 
relation between convex geometry and functional analysis. 
11-3 The following pictures allow us to have a geometric intuition of the norms and their duals.

5 Banac h–Mazur Distance 
Recall from last time the deﬁnition of the Banac h–Mazur distance between two convex bodies: 
Deﬁnition 6 Let K and L be two convex bodies. The Banach–Mazur distanc e d(K, L) is the least positive 
d ∈ R for which theres a linear image L� of L such that L� ⊆ K ⊆ dL�, wher e dL� is the convex body obtaine d 
by multiplying every vector in L� by the scalar d. 
Observ e that the above deﬁni tion takes into consideration only the intrinsic shape of the body, and it is 
indep enden t of any particular choice of coordinate system. Also observ e that the Banac h–Mazur distance is 
symmetric in it’s input argumen ts. If L ⊆ K ⊆ dL, then by scaling everyth ing by d, we get that dL� ⊆ dK. 
Hence K ⊆ dL� ⊆ dK, which implies the symmetry property. 
6 Fritz John’s Theorem 
Let B2 n denote the n-dimensional unit ball. For any two convex bodies K and K�, let d(K, K�) denote the 
Banac h–Mazur distance between them. In the rest of this lecture, we’ll state and prove the Fritz John’s 
theorem. 
Theorem 7 For any n-dimensional, origin-sy mmetric convex body K, d(K, Bn) ≤√n.2 
11-6 �

�	 �In other words, the theorem states that for every origin-symmetric convex body K, there exists some 
ellipsoid E such that E ⊆ K ⊆√nE. We’ll prove that the ellipsoid of maximal volume that is contained in 
K will satisfy the above containmen t. 
Informally , the theorem says that up to a factor of √n, every convex body looks like a ball. The above 
bound of √n is tight for the cube. If we didn’t require the condition that K is origin symmetric, then the 
bound would be n, which would be tight for a simplex. 
The theorem can also be rephrase d as the following: There exists a change of the coordinate basis for 
which Bn ⊆ K ⊆√nB2 n .2 
Theorem 8 Let K be an origin-symmetric convex body. Then K contains a unique ellipsoid of maximal 
volume. Moreover, this largest ellipsoid is B2 n if and only if the following conditions hold: 
Bn • 2 ⊆ K 
•	Ther e are unit vectors u1,u2,...,um on the boundary of K and positive real numb ers c1,c2,...,cm 
such that 
m1. i=1 ciui =0, and 
m 2 22. for all vectors x, i=1 ci�x, ui�= |x|. 
Since the ui are unit vectors, they are points on the convex body K that also belong to the sphere B2 n . 
mAlso, the ﬁrst identity, i.e. i=1 ciui =0, is actually redundan t, since for origin symme tric bodies it can be 
deriv ed from the second identity. This is because for every ui, it’s reﬂection in the origin is also contained 
in K ∩ B2 n . 
The second identity says that the contact points (of the sphere with K) act somewhat like an orthonormal 
basis. They can be weighted so that they are completely isotropic. In other words, the points are not 
concen trated near some proper subspace, but are prett y evenly spread out in all directions. Together they 
mean that the ui can be weighted so that their center of mass is the origin and their inertia tensor is the 
identity. Also, a simple rank argumen t shows that there need to be at least n such contact points, since the 
second identity can only hold for x in the span of the ui. 
6.1 Proof of John’s Theorem 
Proof As part of the proof of John’s Theorem, we’ll prove the following things: 
1. If there exist contact points {ui} as required in the statemen t of Theorem 8, then Bn is the unique 2 
ellipsoid of maximal volume that is contained in K. 
2. If Bn is the unique ellipsoid of maximal volume that is contained in K, then there exist points {ui}2 
such that they satisfy the two identities in Theorem 8. 
Proof of 1: We are given unit vectors u1,u2,...,um on the boundary of K and positiv e real numbers 
m	 m c1,c2,...,cm such that i=1 ciui =0, and for all vectors x, i=1 ci�x, ui�2 = |x|2 . We wish to show that 
B2 n is the unique ellipsoid of maximal volume that is contained in K. Observ e that it suﬃces to show that 
among all axis-aligned ellipsoids contained in K, B2 n is the unique ellipsoid of maximal volume. This is 
because what we are trying to prove doesn’t mention any basis and is only in terms of dot-pro ducts. Hence, 
since the statemen t will remain true under rotati ons, proving it for axis-aligned ellipsoids is enough. 
For each ui we have that for all k ∈ K, ui · k ≤ 1. Hence ui ∈ K∗. Let E be any axis-aligned ellipsoid 
such that E ∈ K. Then K∗ ⊆ E∗. Hence {u1,u2,...,um}⊆ E∗. Since E is axis-aligned, it is of the form � 2 nxi{x| i=1 α2 ≤ 1}. �n	 �n i 
V ol(E)/V ol(B2 n)= i=1 αi. Therefore, to show that V ol(E) < Vol(B2 n), we must show that i=1 αi < 1 
for any such E which is not B2 n .

of the proof.
Proof of 2: Assume that we are give that B2 n is the unique ellipsoid of maximal volume that is contained in
K. We want to show that for some m, there exist ci and ui for 1 ≤ i ≤ m (as in the stateme nt of Theorem 
m 2 28), such that for all vectors x, i=1 ci�x, ui�= |x|. This is equiv alent to showing that

Also, taking trace of both sides, we get that m = n. We already observ ed that for origin-symmetric � i=1 ci mbodies, the condition that i=1 ciui =0, is implied by the previous condition. 
Let UiT . Also, observ e that we can view the space of n×n matrices as a vector of n2 real numbers. = uiui 
2 �Hence we can parametrize the space of n × n matrices by Rn . Hence mT = Idn means that Idn/ni=1 ciuiui 
is in the convex hull of the Ui (recall that the �ci are positiv e and sum to 1). 
mTIf possible, let there be no ci,ui such that i=1 ciuiui = Idn. This means that Idn/n is not in the convex 
hull of the Ui. Hence, there must be a separating hyperplane H in the space of matrices that separates Idn/n 
from the convex hull of the Ui. � 2For two n × n matrices A and B, let A • B denote their dot product in Rn , i.e. A • B = i,j Aij · Bij . 
Thus, the separating hyperplane is a matrix H such that ∀A ∈ conv(Ui),A H ≥ 1, and Idn/n H< 1. 
Let t = Trace(H)= H Idn. Let H� = H − t/n(Idn). Then Idn/n H� = Idn/n (H − t/nIdn)= 
t/n − (Idn/n t/nIdn) = 0. Similarly, since ∀A ∈ conv(Ui), Trace(A) = 1, we get that AH� > 0. Hence, 
H� is such that: 
1. Trace(H�) = 0, and 
2. H� • (uiuiT ) > 0 for all i. 
Now, let Eδ = {x ∈ Rn|xT (Idn +δH�)x ≤ 1. For all i, we have uiT (Idn +δH�)ui = 1+δuiT H�ui > 1, since 
H� • (uiuT ) > 0 ⇒ uT
i H�ui > 0. Hence ui �∈ Eδ. Also, since H� • (uiuT
i ) > 0 for all i, by compactness, there i 
exists �> 0 such that for all matrices w in the �-neigh borhood of the set of all ui satisfy H� • (wwT ) > 0. 
Hence, by the previous argume nt, any such w is not contained in Eδ. 
Note that when δ = 0, we get the unit ball B2 n . For every δ> 0 we have that for all w in the �­
neigh borhood of the contact points of B2 n , w �∈ Eδ. Hence, as we increase δ continuously starting from 0, 
the continuity of the transformation of Eδ implies that for suﬃcien tly small δ, boundary(K) ∩ Eδ = φ. 
Hence ∃�� > 0 such that (1 + ��)Eδ ⊆ K. Therefore, to conclude the proof, it suﬃces to show that 
V ol(Eδ ≥ V ol(Bn).2 �Let λ1,λ2,...,λn be the eigen values of Idn + δH�. Since V ol(Eδ =( n λi)−1, to show that V ol(Eδ ≥i=1

i=1 λi)1/n ≤ ( n
i=1 λi)/n =1. Hence n
i=1 λi ≤ 1. This 
concludes the proof of part 2. 
To wrap up the proof of John’s Theorem, assume without loss of generalit y that B2 n is the ellipsoid of 
maximal volume contained in K. We can make this assumption since the particular choice of basis is not
